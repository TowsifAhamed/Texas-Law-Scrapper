Sec. 6.03.  BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN LESS POPULOUS COUNTIES. (a)  This section applies only to an appraisal district established in a county with a population of less than 75,000.
(a-1)  The appraisal district is governed by a board of directors. Five directors are appointed by the taxing units that participate in the district as provided by this section.  If the county assessor-collector is not appointed to the board, the county assessor-collector serves as a nonvoting director.  The county assessor-collector is ineligible to serve if the board enters into a contract under Section 
6.05
(b) or if the commissioners court of the county enters into a contract under Section 
6.24
(b).  To be eligible to serve on the board of directors, an individual other than a county assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director must be a resident of the district and must have resided in the district for at least two years immediately preceding the date the individual takes office.  An individual who is otherwise eligible to serve on the board is not ineligible because of membership on the governing body of a taxing unit.  An employee of a taxing unit that participates in the district is not eligible to serve on the board unless the individual is also a member of the governing body or an elected official of a taxing unit that participates in the district.
(b)  Members of the board of directors other than a county assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director serve two-year terms beginning on January 1 of even-numbered years.
(c)  Members of the board of directors other than a county assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director are appointed by vote of the governing bodies of the incorporated cities and towns, the school districts, the junior college districts, and, if entitled to vote, the conservation and reclamation districts that participate in the district and of the county.  A governing body may cast all its votes for one candidate or distribute them among candidates for any number of directorships.  Conservation and reclamation districts are not entitled to vote unless at least one conservation and reclamation district in the district delivers to the chief appraiser a written request to nominate and vote on the board of directors by June 1 of each odd-numbered year.  On receipt of a request, the chief appraiser shall certify a list by June 15 of all eligible conservation and reclamation districts that are imposing taxes and that participate in the district.
(d)  The voting entitlement of a taxing unit that is entitled to vote for directors is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of property taxes imposed in the district by the taxing unit for the preceding tax year by the sum of the total dollar amount of property taxes imposed in the district for that year by each taxing unit that is entitled to vote, by multiplying the quotient by 1,000, and by rounding the product to the nearest whole number.  That number is multiplied by the number of directorships to be filled. A taxing unit participating in two or more districts is entitled to vote in each district in which it participates, but only the taxes imposed in a district are used to calculate voting entitlement in that district.
(e)  The chief appraiser shall calculate the number of votes to which each taxing unit other than a conservation and reclamation district is entitled and shall deliver written notice to each of those units of its voting entitlement before October 1 of each odd-numbered year.  The chief appraiser shall deliver the notice:
(1)  to the county judge and each commissioner of the county served by the appraisal district;
(2)  to the presiding officer of the governing body of each city or town participating in the appraisal district, to the city manager of each city or town having a city manager, and to the city secretary or clerk, if there is one, of each city or town that does not have a city manager;
(3)  to the presiding officer of the governing body of each school district participating in the district and to the superintendent of those school districts; and
(4)  to the presiding officer of the governing body of each junior college district participating in the district and to the president, chancellor, or other chief executive officer of those junior college districts.
(f)  The chief appraiser shall calculate the number of votes to which each conservation and reclamation district entitled to vote for district directors is entitled and shall deliver written notice to the presiding officer of each conservation and reclamation district of its voting entitlement and right to nominate a person to serve as a director of the district before July 1 of each odd-numbered year.
(g)  Each taxing unit other than a conservation and reclamation district that is entitled to vote may nominate by resolution adopted by its governing body one candidate for each position to be filled on the board of directors.  The presiding officer of the governing body of the unit shall submit the names of the unit's nominees to the chief appraiser before October 15.
(h)  Each conservation and reclamation district entitled to vote may nominate by resolution adopted by its governing body one candidate for the district's board of directors.  The presiding officer of the conservation and reclamation district's governing body shall submit the name of the district's nominee to the chief appraiser before July 15 of each odd-numbered year.  Before August 1, the chief appraiser shall prepare a nominating ballot, listing all the nominees of conservation and reclamation districts alphabetically by surname, and shall deliver a copy of the nominating ballot to the presiding officer of the board of directors of each district.  The board of directors of each district shall determine its vote by resolution and submit it to the chief appraiser before August 15.  The nominee on the ballot with the most votes is the nominee of the conservation and reclamation districts in the appraisal district if the nominee received more than 10 percent of the votes entitled to be cast by all of the conservation and reclamation districts in the appraisal district, and shall be named on the ballot with the candidates nominated by the other taxing units.  The chief appraiser shall resolve a tie vote by any method of chance.
(i)  If no nominee of the conservation and reclamation districts receives more than 10 percent of the votes entitled to be cast under Subsection (h), the chief appraiser, before September 1, shall notify the presiding officer of the board of directors of each conservation and reclamation district of the failure to select a nominee.  Each conservation and reclamation district may submit a nominee by September 15 to the chief appraiser as provided by Subsection (h).  The chief appraiser shall submit a second nominating ballot by October 1 to the conservation and reclamation districts as provided by Subsection (h).  The conservation and reclamation districts shall submit their votes for nomination before October 15 as provided by Subsection (h).  The nominee on the second nominating ballot with the most votes is the nominee of the conservation and reclamation districts in the appraisal district and shall be named on the ballot with the candidates nominated by the other taxing units.  The chief appraiser shall resolve a tie vote by any method of chance.
(j)  Before October 30, the chief appraiser shall prepare a ballot, listing the candidates whose names were timely submitted under Subsections (g) and, if applicable, (h) or (i) alphabetically according to the first letter in each candidate's surname, and shall deliver a copy of the ballot to the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit that is entitled to vote.
(k)  Except as provided by Subsection (k-1), the governing body of each taxing unit entitled to vote shall determine its vote by resolution and submit it to the chief appraiser before December 15. The chief appraiser shall count the votes, declare the five candidates who receive the largest cumulative vote totals elected, and submit the results before December 31 to the governing body of each taxing unit in the district and to the candidates. For purposes of determining the number of votes received by the candidates, the candidate receiving the most votes of the conservation and reclamation districts is considered to have received all of the votes cast by conservation and reclamation districts and the other candidates are considered not to have received any votes of the conservation and reclamation districts. The chief appraiser shall resolve a tie vote by any method of chance.
(k-1)  This subsection applies only to an appraisal district established in a county with a population of 120,000 or more. The governing body of each taxing unit entitled to cast at least five percent of the total votes must determine its vote by resolution adopted at the first or second open meeting of the governing body that is held after the date the chief appraiser delivers the ballot to the presiding officer of the governing body. The governing body must submit its vote to the chief appraiser not later than the third day following the date the resolution is adopted.
(l)  If a vacancy occurs on the board of directors other than a vacancy in the position held by a county assessor-collector serving as a nonvoting director, each taxing unit that is entitled to vote by this section may nominate by resolution adopted by its governing body a candidate to fill the vacancy.  The unit shall submit the name of its nominee to the chief appraiser within 45 days after notification from the board of directors of the existence of the vacancy, and the chief appraiser shall prepare and deliver to the board of directors within the next five days a list of the nominees.  The board of directors shall elect by majority vote of its members one of the nominees to fill the vacancy.

Sec. 6.033.  RECALL OF APPOINTED DIRECTOR.  (a)  The governing body of a taxing unit may call for the recall of an appointed member of the board of directors of an appraisal district for whom the taxing unit cast any of its votes in the appointment of the board.  The call must be in the form of a resolution, be filed with the chief appraiser of the appraisal district, and state that the taxing unit is calling for the recall of the member.  If a resolution calling for the recall of a board member is filed under this subsection, the chief appraiser, not later than the 10th day after the date of filing, shall deliver a written notice of the filing of the resolution and the date of its filing to the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit entitled to vote in the appointment of board members.
(b)  On or before the 30th day after the date on which a resolution calling for the recall of a member of the board is filed, the governing body of a taxing unit that cast any of its votes in the appointment of the board for that member may vote to recall the member by resolution submitted to the chief appraiser.  Each taxing unit is entitled to the same number of votes in the recall as it cast for that member in the appointment of the board.  The governing body of the taxing unit calling for the recall may cast its votes in favor of the recall in the same resolution in which it called for the recall.
(c)  Not later than the 10th day after the last day provided by this section for voting in favor of the recall, the chief appraiser shall count the votes cast in favor of the recall.  If the number of votes in favor of the recall equals or exceeds a majority of the votes cast for the member in the appointment of the board, the member is recalled and ceases to be a member of the board.  The chief appraiser shall immediately notify in writing the presiding officer of the appraisal district board of directors and of the governing body of each taxing unit that voted in the recall election of the outcome of the recall election.  If the presiding officer of the appraisal district board of directors is the member whose recall was voted on, the chief appraiser shall also notify the secretary of the appraisal district board of directors of the outcome of the recall election.
(d)  If a vacancy occurs on the board of directors after the recall of a member of the board under this section, the taxing units that were entitled to vote in the recall election shall appoint a new board member.  Each taxing unit is entitled to the same number of votes as it originally cast to appoint the recalled board member.  Each taxing unit entitled to vote may nominate one candidate by resolution adopted by its governing body.  The presiding officer of the governing body of the unit shall submit the name of the unit's nominee to the chief appraiser on or before the 30th day after the date it receives notification from the chief appraiser of the result of the recall election.  On or before the 15th day after the last day provided for a nomination to be submitted, the chief appraiser shall prepare a ballot, listing the candidates nominated alphabetically according to each candidate's surname, and shall deliver a copy of the ballot to the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit that is entitled to vote.  On or before the 15th day after the date on which a taxing unit's ballot is delivered, the governing body of the taxing unit shall determine its vote by resolution and submit it to the chief appraiser.  On or before the 15th day after the last day on which a taxing unit may vote, the chief appraiser shall count the votes, declare the candidate who received the largest vote total appointed, and submit the results to the presiding officer of the governing body of the appraisal district and of each taxing unit in the district and to the candidates.  The chief appraiser shall resolve a tie vote by any method of chance.
(e)  If the board of directors of an appraisal district is appointed by a method or procedure adopted under Section 
6.031
 of this code, the governing bodies of the taxing units that voted for or otherwise participated in the appointment of a member of the board may recall that member and appoint a new member to the vacancy by any method adopted by resolution of a majority of those governing bodies.

Sec. 6.034.  OPTIONAL STAGGERED TERMS FOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  (a)  The taxing units participating in an appraisal district may provide that the terms of the appointed members of the board of directors be staggered if the governing bodies of at least three-fourths of the taxing units that are entitled to vote on the appointment of board members adopt resolutions providing for the staggered terms.  A change to staggered terms may be adopted only if the method or procedure for appointing board members is changed under Section 
6.031
 of this code to eliminate or have the effect of eliminating cumulative voting for board members as provided by Section 
6.03
 of this code.  A change to staggered terms may be proposed concurrently with a change that eliminates or has the effect of eliminating cumulative voting.
(b)  An official copy of a resolution providing for staggered terms adopted by the governing body of a taxing unit must be filed with the chief appraiser of the appraisal district after June 30 and before October 1 of a year in which board members are to be appointed, or the resolution is ineffective.
(c)  Before October 5 of each year in which board members are to be appointed, the chief appraiser shall determine whether a sufficient number of taxing units have filed valid resolutions proposing a change to staggered terms for the change to take effect.  Before October 10 the chief appraiser shall notify each taxing unit participating in the district of a change that is adopted under this section.
(d)  A change to staggered terms made under this section becomes effective beginning on January 1 of the next even-numbered year after the chief appraiser determines that the change has been adopted.  The entire board of directors shall be appointed for that year without regard to the staggered terms.  At the earliest practical date after January 1 of that year, the board shall determine by lot which of its members shall serve one-year terms and which shall serve two-year terms in order to implement the staggered terms.  If the board consists of an even number of board members, one-half of the members must be designated to serve one-year terms and one-half shall be designated to serve two-year terms.  If the board consists of an odd number of board members, the number of members designated to serve two-year terms must exceed by one the number of members designated to serve one-year terms.
(e)  After the staggered terms have been implemented as provided by Subsection (d) of this section, the appraisal district shall appoint annually for terms to begin on January 1 of each year a number of board members equal to the number of board members whose terms expire on that January 1, unless a change in the total number of board members is adopted under Section 
6.031
 of this code to take effect on that January 1.
(f)  If a change in the number of directors is adopted under Section 
6.031
 of this code in an appraisal district that has adopted staggered terms for board members, the change must specify how many members' terms are to begin in even-numbered years and how many members' terms are to begin in odd-numbered years.  The change may not provide that the number of members whose terms are to begin in even-numbered years differs by more than one from the number of members whose terms are to begin in odd-numbered years.
(g)  A change to staggered terms made as provided by this section may be rescinded by resolution of a majority of the governing bodies that are entitled to vote on appointment of board members under Section 
6.03
 of this code.  To be effective, a resolution providing for the rescission must be adopted by the governing body and filed with the chief appraiser after June 30 and before October 1 of an odd-numbered year.  If the required number of resolutions are filed during that period, the chief appraiser shall notify each taxing unit participating in the district that the rescission is adopted.  If the rescission is adopted, the terms of all members of the board serving at the time of the adoption expire on January 1 of the even-numbered year following the adoption, including terms of members who will have served only one year of a two-year term on that date.  The entire board of directors shall be appointed for two-year terms beginning on that date.
(h)  If an appraisal district that has adopted staggered terms adopts or rescinds a change in the method or procedure for appointing board members and the change or rescission results in a method of appointing board members by cumulative voting, the change or rescission has the same effect as a rescission of the change to staggered terms made under Subsection (g) of this section.
(i)  If a vacancy occurs on the board of directors of an appraisal district that has adopted staggered terms for board members, the vacancy shall be filled by appointment by resolution of the governing body of the taxing unit that nominated the person whose departure from the board caused the vacancy, and the procedure for filling a vacancy provided by Section 
6.03
 of this code does not apply in that event.

Sec. 6.06.  APPRAISAL DISTRICT BUDGET AND FINANCING.  (a)  Each year the chief appraiser shall prepare a proposed budget for the operations of the district for the following tax year and shall submit copies to each taxing unit participating in the district and to the district board of directors before June 15.  He shall include in the budget a list showing each proposed position, the proposed salary for the position, all benefits proposed for the position, each proposed capital expenditure, and an estimate of the amount of the budget that will be allocated to each taxing unit.  Each taxing unit entitled to vote on the appointment of board members shall maintain a copy of the proposed budget for public inspection at its principal administrative office.
(b)  The board of directors shall hold a public hearing to consider the budget.  The secretary of the board shall deliver to the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit participating in the district not later than the 10th day before the date of the hearing a written notice of the date, time, and place fixed for the hearing.  The board shall complete its hearings, make any amendments to the proposed budget it desires, and finally approve a budget before September 15.  If governing bodies of a majority of the taxing units entitled to vote on the appointment of board members adopt resolutions disapproving a budget and file them with the secretary of the board within 30 days after its adoption, the budget does not take effect, and the board shall adopt a new budget within 30 days of the disapproval.
(c)  The board may amend the approved budget at any time, but the secretary of the board must deliver a written copy of a proposed amendment to the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit participating in the district not later than the 30th day before the date the board acts on it.
(d)  Each taxing unit participating in the district is allocated a portion of the amount of the budget equal to the proportion that the total dollar amount of property taxes imposed in the district by the unit for the tax year in which the budget proposal is prepared bears to the sum of the total dollar amount of property taxes imposed in the district by each participating unit for that year.  If a taxing unit participates in two or more districts, only the taxes imposed in a district are used to calculate the unit's cost allocations in that district.  If the number of real property parcels in a taxing unit is less than 5 percent of the total number of real property parcels in the district and the taxing unit imposes in excess of 25 percent of the total amount of the property taxes imposed in the district by all of the participating taxing units for a year, the unit's allocation may not exceed a percentage of the appraisal district's budget equal to three times the unit's percentage of the total number of real property parcels appraised by the district.
(e)  Unless the governing body of a unit and the chief appraiser agree to a different method of payment, each taxing unit shall pay its allocation in four equal payments to be made at the end of each calendar quarter, and the first payment shall be made before January 1 of the year in which the budget takes effect.  A payment is delinquent if not paid on the date it is due.  A delinquent payment incurs a penalty of 5 percent of the amount of the payment and accrues interest at an annual rate of 10 percent.  If the budget is amended, any change in the amount of a unit's allocation is apportioned among the payments remaining.
(f)  Payments shall be made to a depository designated by the district board of directors.  The district's funds may be disbursed only by a written check, draft, or order signed by the chairman and secretary of the board or, if authorized by resolution of the board, by the chief appraiser.
(g)  If a taxing unit decides not to impose taxes for any tax year, the unit is not liable for any of the costs of operating the district in that year, and those costs are allocated among the other taxing units as if that unit had not imposed taxes in the year used to calculate allocations.  However, if that unit has made any payments, it is not entitled to a refund.
(h)  If a newly formed taxing unit or a taxing unit that did not impose taxes in the preceding year imposes taxes in any tax year, that unit is allocated a portion of the amount budgeted to operate the district as if it had imposed taxes in the preceding year, except that the amount of taxes the unit imposes in the current year is used to calculate its allocation.  Before the amount of taxes to be imposed for the current year is known, the allocation may be based on an estimate to which the district board of directors and the governing body of the unit agree, and the payments made after that amount is known shall be adjusted to reflect the amount imposed.  The payments of a newly formed taxing unit that has no source of funds are postponed until the unit has received adequate tax or other revenues.
(i)  The fiscal year of an appraisal district is the calendar year unless the governing bodies of three-fourths of the taxing units entitled to vote on the appointment of board members adopt resolutions proposing a different fiscal year and file them with the secretary of the board not more than 12 and not less than eight months before the first day of the fiscal year proposed by the resolutions.  If the fiscal year of an appraisal district is changed under this subsection, the chief appraiser shall prepare a proposed budget for the fiscal year as provided by Subsection (a) of this section before the 15th day of the seventh month preceding the first day of the fiscal year established by the change, and the board of directors shall adopt a budget for the fiscal year as provided by Subsection (b) of this section before the 15th day of the fourth month preceding the first day of the fiscal year established by the change.  Unless the appraisal district adopts a different method of allocation under Section 
6.061
 of this code, the allocation of the budget to each taxing unit shall be calculated as provided by Subsection (d) of this section using the amount of property taxes imposed by each participating taxing unit in the most recent tax year preceding the fiscal year established by the change for which the necessary information is available.  Each taxing unit shall pay its allocation as provided by Subsection (e) of this section, except that the first payment shall be made before the first day of the fiscal year established by the change and subsequent payments shall be made quarterly.  In the year in which a change in the fiscal year occurs, the budget that takes effect on January 1 of that year may be amended as necessary as provided by Subsection (c) of this section in order to accomplish the change in fiscal years.
(j)  If the total amount of the payments made or due to be made by the taxing units participating in an appraisal district exceeds the amount actually spent or obligated to be spent during the fiscal year for which the payments were made, the chief appraiser shall credit the excess amount against each taxing unit's allocated payments for the following year in proportion to the amount of each unit's budget allocation for the fiscal year for which the payments were made.  If a taxing unit that paid its allocated amount is not allocated a portion of the district's budget for the following fiscal year, the chief appraiser shall refund to the taxing unit its proportionate share of the excess funds not later than the 150th day after the end of the fiscal year for which the payments were made.
(k)  For good cause shown, the board of directors may waive the penalty and interest on a delinquent payment under Subsection (e).

 of this code without the consent of the governing body of that unit.

Before May 25, the chief appraiser shall notify each taxing unit participating in the district of each change that is adopted.
(e)  A change in allocation of district costs made as provided by this section remains in effect until changed in a manner provided by this section or rescinded by resolution of a majority of the governing bodies that are entitled to vote on appointment of board members under Section

Sec. 11.13.  RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD.  (a)  A family or single adult is entitled to an exemption from taxation for the county purposes authorized in Article VIII, Section 
1-a
, of the Texas Constitution of $3,000 of the assessed value of his residence homestead.
(b)  An adult is entitled to exemption from taxation by a school district of $100,000 of the appraised value of the adult's residence homestead, except that only $5,000 of the exemption applies to an entity operating under former Chapter 17, 
18
, 
25
, 
26
, 
27
, or 
28
, Education Code, as those chapters existed on May 1, 1995, as permitted by Section 
11.301
, Education Code.
(c)  In addition to the exemption provided by Subsection (b) of this section, an adult who is disabled or is 65 or older is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a school district of $10,000 of the appraised value of his residence homestead.
(d)  In addition to the exemptions provided by Subsections (b) and (c) of this section, an individual who is disabled or is 65 or older is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a taxing unit of a portion (the amount of which is fixed as provided by Subsection (e) of this section) of the appraised value of his residence homestead if the exemption is adopted either:
(1)  by the governing body of the taxing unit;  or
(2)  by a favorable vote of a majority of the qualified voters of the taxing unit at an election called by the governing body of a taxing unit, and the governing body shall call the election on the petition of at least 20 percent of the number of qualified voters who voted in the preceding election of the taxing unit.
(e)  The amount of an exemption adopted as provided by Subsection (d) of this section is $3,000 of the appraised value of the residence homestead unless a larger amount is specified by:
(1)  the governing body authorizing the exemption if the exemption is authorized as provided by Subdivision (1) of Subsection (d) of this section;  or
(2)  the petition for the election if the exemption is authorized as provided by Subdivision (2) of Subsection (d) of this section.
(f)  Once authorized, an exemption adopted as provided by Subsection (d) of this section may be repealed or decreased or increased in amount by the governing body of the taxing unit or by the procedure authorized by Subdivision (2) of Subsection (d) of this section.  In the case of a decrease, the amount of the exemption may not be reduced to less than $3,000 of the market value.
(g)  If the residence homestead exemption provided by Subsection (d) of this section is adopted by a county that levies a tax for the county purposes authorized by Article VIII, Section 
1-a
, of the Texas Constitution, the residence homestead exemptions provided by Subsections (a) and (d) of this section may not be aggregated for the county tax purposes.

(i)  The assessor and collector for a taxing unit may disregard the exemptions authorized by Subsection (b), (c), (d), or (n) of this section and assess and collect a tax pledged for payment of debt without deducting the amount of the exemption if:
(1)  prior to adoption of the exemption, the unit pledged the taxes for the payment of a debt;  and
(2)  granting the exemption would impair the obligation of the contract creating the debt.
(j)  For purposes of this section:
(1)  "Residence homestead" means a structure (including a mobile home) or a separately secured and occupied portion of a structure (together with the land, not to exceed 20 acres, and improvements used in the residential occupancy of the structure, if the structure and the land and improvements have identical ownership) that:
(A)  is owned by one or more individuals, either directly or through a beneficial interest in a qualifying trust;
(B)  is designed or adapted for human residence;
(C)  is used as a residence; and
(D)  is occupied as the individual's principal residence by an owner, by an owner's surviving spouse who has a life estate in the property, or, for property owned through a beneficial interest in a qualifying trust, by a trustor or beneficiary of the trust who qualifies for the exemption.
(2)  "Trustor" means a person who transfers an interest in real or personal property to a qualifying trust, whether during the person's lifetime or at death, or the person's spouse.
(3)  "Qualifying trust" means a trust:
(A)  in which the agreement, will, or court order creating the trust, an instrument transferring property to the trust, or any other agreement that is binding on the trustee provides that the trustor of the trust or a beneficiary of the trust has the right to use and occupy as the trustor's or beneficiary's principal residence residential property rent free and without charge except for taxes and other costs and expenses specified in the instrument or court order:
(i)  for life;
(ii)  for the lesser of life or a term of years; or

(i)  describes the property with sufficient certainty to identify it and the interest acquired; and
(ii)  is recorded in the real property records of the county in which the property is located.
(k)  A qualified residential structure does not lose its character as a residence homestead if a portion of the structure is rented to another or is used primarily for other purposes that are incompatible with the owner's residential use of the structure.  However, the amount of any residence homestead exemption does not apply to the value of that portion of the structure that is used primarily for purposes that are incompatible with the owner's residential use.
(l)  A qualified residential structure does not lose its character as a residence homestead when the owner who qualifies for the exemption temporarily stops occupying it as a principal residence if that owner does not establish a different principal residence and the absence is:
(1)  for a period of less than two years and the owner intends to return and occupy the structure as the owner's principal residence; or
(2)  caused by the owner's:
(A)  military service inside or outside of the United States as a member of the armed forces of the United States or of this state; or
(B)  residency in a facility that provides services related to health, infirmity, or aging.
(m)  In this section:
(1)  "Disabled" means under a disability for purposes of payment of disability insurance benefits under Federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance.
(2)  "School district" means a political subdivision organized to provide general elementary and secondary public education.  "School district" does not include a junior college district or a political subdivision organized to provide special education services.
(n)  In addition to any other exemptions provided by this section, an individual is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a taxing unit of a percentage of the appraised value of his residence homestead if the exemption is adopted by the governing body of the taxing unit before July 1 in the manner provided by law for official action by the body.  If the percentage set by the taxing unit produces an exemption in a tax year of less than $5,000 when applied to a particular residence homestead, the individual is entitled to an exemption of $5,000 of the appraised value.  The percentage adopted by the taxing unit may not exceed 20 percent.
(n-1)  The governing body of a school district, municipality, or county that adopted an exemption under Subsection (n) for the 2022 tax year may not reduce the amount of or repeal the exemption.  This subsection expires December 31, 2027.

(1)  the interests of the stockholders of the corporation are appraised separately as provided by Section 
23.19
 of this code in the tax year to which the exemption applies;
(2)  ownership of the stock entitles the owner to occupy a dwelling place owned by the corporation;
(3)  the dwelling place is a structure or a separately secured and occupied portion of a structure;  and
(4)  the dwelling place is occupied as his principal residence by a stockholder who qualifies for the exemption.
(p)  Exemption under this section for a homestead described by Subsection (o) of this section extends only to the dwelling place occupied as a residence homestead and to a portion of the total common area used in the residential occupancy that is equal to the percentage of the total amount of the stock issued by the corporation that is owned by the homestead claimant.  The size of a residence homestead under Subsection (o) of this section, including any relevant portion of common area, may not exceed 20 acres.
(q)  The surviving spouse of an individual who qualifies for an exemption under Subsection (d) for the residence homestead of a person 65 or older is entitled to an exemption for the same property from the same taxing unit in an amount equal to that of the exemption for which the deceased spouse qualified if:
(1)  the deceased spouse died in a year in which the deceased spouse qualified for the exemption;
(2)  the surviving spouse was 55 or older when the deceased spouse died;  and
(3)  the property was the residence homestead of the surviving spouse when the deceased spouse died and remains the residence homestead of the surviving spouse.
(r)  An individual who receives an exemption under Subsection (d) is not entitled to an exemption under Subsection (q).

Sec. 11.1801.  CHARITY CARE AND COMMUNITY BENEFITS REQUIREMENTS FOR CHARITABLE HOSPITAL.  (a)  To qualify as a charitable organization under Section 
11.18
(d)(1), a nonprofit hospital or hospital system must provide charity care and community benefits as follows:
(1)  charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care must be provided at a level that is reasonable in relation to the community needs, as determined through the community needs assessment, the available resources of the hospital or hospital system, and the tax-exempt benefits received by the hospital or hospital system;
(2)  charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care must be provided in an amount equal to at least four percent of the hospital's or hospital system's net patient revenue;
(3)  charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care must be provided in an amount equal to at least 100 percent of the hospital's or hospital system's tax-exempt benefits, excluding federal income tax;  or
(4)  charity care and community benefits must be provided in a combined amount equal to at least five percent of the hospital's or hospital system's net patient revenue, provided that charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care are provided in an amount equal to at least four percent of net patient revenue.
(b)  A nonprofit hospital that has been designated as a disproportionate share hospital under the state Medicaid program in the current year or in either of the previous two fiscal years shall be considered to have provided a reasonable amount of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care and is considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a).
(c)  A hospital operated on a nonprofit basis that is located in a county with a population of less than 58,000 and in which the entire county or the population of the entire county has been designated as a health professionals shortage area is considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a).
(d)  A hospital providing health care services to inpatients or outpatients without receiving any payment for providing those services from any source, including the patient or person legally obligated to support the patient, third-party payors, Medicare, Medicaid, or any other state or local indigent care program but excluding charitable donations, legacies, bequests, or grants or payments for research, is considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a).
(e)  For purposes of complying with Subsection (a)(4), a hospital or hospital system may not change its existing fiscal year unless the hospital or hospital system changes its ownership or corporate structure as a result of a sale or merger.
(f)  For purposes of this section, a hospital that complies with Subsection (a)(1) or that is considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a) under Subsection (b), (c), or (d) shall be excluded in determining a hospital system's compliance with the standards in Subsection (a)(2), (3), or (4).
(g)  For purposes of this section, "charity care," "government-sponsored indigent health care," "health care organization," "hospital system," "net patient revenue," "nonprofit hospital," and "tax-exempt benefits" have the meanings assigned by Sections 
311.031
 and 
311.042
, Health and Safety Code.  A determination of the amount of community benefits and charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care provided by a hospital or hospital system and the hospital's or hospital system's compliance with Section 
311.045
, Health and Safety Code, shall be based on the most recently completed and audited prior fiscal year of the hospital or hospital system.
(h)  The providing of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care in accordance with Subsection (a)(1) shall be guided by the prudent business judgment of the hospital, which will ultimately determine the appropriate level of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care based on the community needs, the available resources of the hospital, the tax-exempt benefits received by the hospital, and other factors that may be unique to the hospital, such as the hospital's volume of Medicare and Medicaid patients.  These criteria shall not be determinative factors, but shall be guidelines contributing to the hospital's decision along with other factors that may be unique to the hospital.  The formulas in Subsections (a)(2), (3), and (4) shall also not be considered determinative of a reasonable amount of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care.
(i)  The requirements of this section shall not apply to the extent a hospital or hospital system demonstrates that reductions in the amount of community benefits, charity care, and government-sponsored indigent health care are necessary to maintain financial reserves at a level required by a bond covenant or are necessary to prevent the hospital or hospital system from endangering its ability to continue operations, or if the hospital or hospital system, as a result of a natural or other disaster, is required substantially to curtail its operations.
(j)  In any fiscal year that a hospital or hospital system, through unintended miscalculation, fails to meet any of the standards in Subsection (a) or fails to be considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a) under Subsection (b), (c), or (d), the hospital or hospital system shall not lose its tax-exempt status without the opportunity to cure the miscalculation in the fiscal year following the fiscal year the failure is discovered by both meeting one of the standards and providing an additional amount of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care that is equal to the shortfall from the previous fiscal year.  A hospital or hospital system may apply this provision only once every five years.

11.18
(e) and (f);
(2)  owns the property for the purpose of building or repairing housing on the property primarily with volunteer labor to sell without profit to an individual or family satisfying the organization's low-income and other eligibility requirements;  and
(3)  engages exclusively in the building, repair, and sale of housing as described by Subdivision (2), and related activities.
(b)  Property may not be exempted under Subsection (a) after the fifth anniversary of the date the organization acquires the property.  Property that received an exemption under Section 
11.1825
 and that was subsequently transferred by the organization described by that section that qualified for the exemption to an organization described by this section may not be exempted under Subsection (a) after the fifth anniversary of the date the transferring organization acquired the property.
(c)  An organization entitled to an exemption under Subsection (a) is also entitled to an exemption from taxation of any building or tangible personal property the organization owns and uses in the administration of its acquisition, building, repair, or sale of property.  To qualify for an exemption under this subsection, property must be used exclusively by the charitable organization, except that another individual or organization may use the property for activities incidental to the charitable organization's use that benefit the beneficiaries of the charitable organization.
(d)  For the purposes of Subsection (e), the chief appraiser shall determine the market value of property exempted under Subsection (a) and shall record the market value in the appraisal records.
(e)  If the organization that owns improved or unimproved real property that has been exempted under Subsection (a) sells the property to a person other than an individual or family satisfying the organization's low-income or other eligibility requirements, a penalty is imposed on the property equal to the amount of the taxes that would have been imposed on the property in each tax year that the property was exempted from taxation under Subsection (a), plus interest at an annual rate of 12 percent calculated from the dates on which the taxes would have become due.
(f)  The charitable organization and the purchaser of the property from that organization are jointly and severally liable for the penalty and interest imposed under Subsection (e).  A tax lien in favor of all taxing units for which the penalty is imposed attaches to the property to secure payment of the penalty and interest.
(g)  The chief appraiser shall make an entry in the appraisal records for the property against which a penalty under Subsection (e) is imposed and shall deliver written notice of the imposition of the penalty and interest to the charitable organization and to the person who purchased the property from that organization.

(k)  Notwithstanding Subsection (j) of this section and Sections 
11.43
(a) and (c), an exemption under Subsection (b) or (f) does not terminate because of a change in the ownership of the property if the property is sold at a foreclosure sale and, not later than the 30th day after the date of the sale, the owner of the property submits to the chief appraiser evidence that the property is owned by an organization that meets the requirements of Subsections (b)(1), (2), and (4).

(h)  The annual total of the monthly rent charged or to be charged for each dwelling unit in the project reserved for an individual or family described by Subsection (f) may not exceed 30 percent of the area median family income for the household's place of residence, as adjusted for family size and as established by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.

11.181
(a) is a proper use of and purpose for owning the property under this section and does not affect the eligibility of the property for an exemption under this section.
(q)  If property qualifies for an exemption under this section, the chief appraiser shall use the income method of appraisal as described by Section 
23.012
 to determine the appraised value of the property.  The chief appraiser shall use that method regardless of whether the chief appraiser considers that method to be the most appropriate method of appraising the property.  In appraising the property, the chief appraiser shall:
(1)  consider the restrictions provided by this section on the income of the individuals or families to whom the dwelling units of the housing project may be rented and the amount of rent that may be charged for purposes of computing the actual rental income from the property or projecting future rental income; and
(2)  use the same capitalization rate that the chief appraiser uses to appraise other rent-restricted properties.
(r)  Not later than January 31 of each year, the appraisal district shall give public notice in the manner determined by the district, including posting on the district's website if applicable, of the capitalization rate to be used in that year to appraise property receiving an exemption under this section.

(A)  an organization that meets the requirements of Subsection (b);  or
(B)  an entity that meets the requirements of Subsections (c) and (d);  or

(x)  Not later than the 60th day after the date the governing body of the taxing unit receives a written request under Subsection (w) for an exemption under this section, the governing body shall:
(1)  approve the exemption in the amount provided by Subsection (s);
(2)  approve the exemption in a reasonable amount other than the amount provided by Subsection (s);  or
(3)  deny the exemption if the governing body determines that:
(A)  the taxing unit cannot afford the loss of ad valorem tax revenue that would result from approving the exemption;  or
(B)  additional housing for individuals or families meeting the income eligibility requirements of this section is not needed in the territory of the taxing unit.
(y)  Not later than the fifth day after the date the governing body of the taxing unit takes action under Subsection (x), the taxing unit shall issue a letter to the organization stating the governing body's action and, if the governing body denied the exemption, stating whether the denial was based on a determination under Subsection (x)(3)(A) or (B) and the basis for the determination.  The taxing unit shall send a copy of the letter by regular mail to the chief appraiser of each appraisal district that appraises the property for the taxing unit.  The governing body may charge the organization a fee not to exceed the administrative costs of processing the request of the organization, approving or denying the exemption, and issuing the letter required by this subsection.  If the chief appraiser determines that the property qualifies for an exemption under this section and the governing body of the taxing unit approves the exemption, the chief appraiser shall grant the exemption in the amount approved by the governing body.

Sec. 11.251.  TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY EXEMPT.  (a)  In this section, "freeport goods" means property that under Article VIII, Section 
1-j
, of the Texas Constitution is not taxable.  
(b)  A person is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a taxing unit of the appraised value of that portion of the person's inventory or property consisting of freeport goods as determined under this section for the taxing unit.
(c)  The exemption provided by Subsection (b) is subtracted from the market value of the inventory or property determined under Section 
23.12
 to determine the taxable value of the inventory or property for the taxing unit.
(d)  Except as provided by Subsections (f) and (g), the chief appraiser shall determine the appraised value of freeport goods under this subsection.  The chief appraiser shall determine the percentage of the market value of inventory or property owned by the property owner in the preceding calendar year that was contributed by freeport goods.  The chief appraiser shall apply that percentage to the market value of the property owner's inventory or property for the current year to determine the appraised value of freeport goods for the current year.
(e)  In determining the market value of freeport goods that in the preceding year were assembled, manufactured, repaired, maintained, processed, or fabricated in this state or used by the person who acquired or imported the property in the repair or maintenance of aircraft operated by a certificated air carrier, the chief appraiser shall exclude the cost of equipment, machinery, or materials that entered into and became component parts of the freeport goods but were not themselves freeport goods or that were not transported outside the state before the expiration of 175 days, or, if applicable, the greater number of days adopted by the taxing unit as authorized by Subsection (l), after they were brought into this state by the property owner or acquired by the property owner in this state. For component parts held in bulk, the chief appraiser may use the average length of time a component part was held in this state by the property owner during the preceding year in determining whether the component parts were transported out of this state before the expiration of 175 days or, if applicable, the greater number of days adopted by the taxing unit as authorized by Subsection (l).
(f)  If the property owner was not engaged in transporting freeport goods out of this state for the entire preceding year, the chief appraiser shall calculate the percentage of cost described in Subsection (d) for the portion of the year in which the property owner was engaged in transporting freeport goods out of this state.
(g)  If the property owner or the chief appraiser demonstrates that the method provided by Subsection (d) significantly understates or overstates the market value of the property qualified for an exemption under Subsection (b) in the current year, the chief appraiser shall determine the market value of the freeport goods to be exempt by determining, according to the property owner's records and any other available information, the market value of those freeport goods owned by the property owner on January 1 of the current year, excluding the cost of equipment, machinery, or materials that entered into and became component parts of the freeport goods but were not themselves freeport goods or that were not transported outside the state before the expiration of 175 days, or, if applicable, the greater number of days adopted by the taxing unit as authorized by Subsection (l), after they were brought into this state by the property owner or acquired by the property owner in this state.
(h)  The chief appraiser by written notice delivered to a property owner who claims an exemption under this section may require the property owner or a person designated in writing by the importer of record to provide copies of inventory or property records in order to determine the amount and value of freeport goods.  If the property owner or designated person fails to deliver the information requested in the notice before the 31st day after the date the notice is delivered to the property owner or before the date the appraisal review board approves the appraisal records under Section 
41.12
, whichever is later, the property owner forfeits the right to claim or receive the exemption for that year.  If the property owner or designated person delivers the information requested in the notice before the date the appraisal review board approves the appraisal records but not before the 31st day after the date the notice is delivered to the property owner and the exemption is allowed, the property owner is liable to each taxing unit for a penalty in an amount equal to 10 percent of the difference between the amount of tax imposed by the taxing unit on the inventory or property and the amount that would otherwise have been imposed.  The chief appraiser shall make an entry on the appraisal records for the inventory or property indicating the property owner's liability for the penalty and shall deliver a written notice of imposition of the penalty, explaining the reason for its imposition, to the property owner.  The assessor for a taxing unit that taxes the inventory or property shall add the amount of the penalty to the property owner's tax bill, and the tax collector for the unit shall collect the penalty at the time and in the manner the collector collects the tax.  The amount of the penalty constitutes a lien against the inventory or property against which the penalty is imposed, as if it were a tax, and accrues penalty and interest in the same manner as a delinquent tax.
(i)  The exemption provided by Subsection (b) does not apply to a taxing unit that takes action to tax the property under Article VIII, Section 1-j, Subsection (b), of the Texas Constitution.
(j)  Petroleum products as set forth in Article VIII, Section 
1-j
, of the Texas Constitution shall mean liquid and gaseous materials that are the immediate derivatives of the refining of oil or natural gas.
(k)  Property that meets the requirements of Article VIII, Sections 
1-j
(a)(1) and (2), of the Texas Constitution and that is transported outside of this state not later than 175 days, or, if applicable, the greater number of days adopted by the taxing unit as authorized by Subsection (l), after the date the person who owns it on January 1 acquired it or imported it into this state is freeport goods regardless of whether the person who owns it on January 1 is the person who transports it outside of this state.
(l)  The governing body of a taxing unit, in the manner provided by law for official action, may extend the date by which freeport goods that are aircraft parts must be transported outside the state to a date not later than the 730th day after the date the person acquired or imported the property in this state.  An extension adopted by official action under this subsection applies only to the exemption from ad valorem taxation by the taxing unit adopting the extension and applies to:
(1)  the tax year:
(A)  in which the extension is adopted if officially adopted before June 1 of a tax year; or
(B)  immediately following the tax year in which the extension is adopted if officially adopted on or after June 1 of a tax year; and
(2)  each tax year following the year of adoption of the extension.

(b)  A person is entitled to an exemption from taxation of the appraised value of that portion of the person's property that consists of goods-in-transit.
(c)  The exemption provided by Subsection (b) is subtracted from the market value of the property determined under Section 
23.01
 or 
23.12
, as applicable, to determine the taxable value of the property.
(d)  Except as provided by Subsections (f) and (g), the chief appraiser shall determine the appraised value of goods-in-transit under this subsection.  The chief appraiser shall determine the percentage of the market value of tangible personal property owned by the property owner and used for the production of income in the preceding calendar year that was contributed by goods-in-transit.  For the first year in which the exemption applies to a taxing unit, the chief appraiser shall determine that percentage as if the exemption applied in the preceding year.  The chief appraiser shall apply that percentage to the market value of the property owner's tangible personal property used for the production of income for the current year to determine the appraised value of goods-in-transit for the current year.
(e)  In determining the market value of goods-in-transit that in the preceding year were stored in this state, the chief appraiser shall exclude the cost of equipment, machinery, or materials that entered into and became component parts of the goods-in-transit but were not themselves goods-in-transit or that were not transported to another location in this state or outside this state before the expiration of 175 days after the date they were brought into this state by the property owner or acquired by the property owner in this state.  For component parts held in bulk, the chief appraiser may use the average length of time a component part was held by the owner of the component parts during the preceding year at a location in this state that was not owned by or under the control of the owner of the component parts in determining whether the component parts were transported to another location in this state or outside this state before the expiration of 175 days.

(g)  If the property owner or the chief appraiser demonstrates that the method provided by Subsection (d) significantly understates or overstates the market value of the property qualified for an exemption under Subsection (b) in the current year, the chief appraiser shall determine the market value of the goods-in-transit to be exempt by determining, according to the property owner's records and any other available information, the market value of those goods-in-transit owned by the property owner on January 1 of the current year, excluding the cost of equipment, machinery, or materials that entered into and became component parts of the goods-in-transit but were not themselves goods-in-transit or that were not transported to another location in this state or outside this state before the expiration of 175 days after the date they were brought into this state by the property owner or acquired by the property owner in this state.
(h)  The chief appraiser by written notice delivered to a property owner who claims an exemption under this section may require the property owner to provide copies of property records so the chief appraiser can determine the amount and value of goods-in-transit and that the location in this state where the goods-in-transit were detained for storage was not owned by or under the control of the owner of the goods-in-transit.

Before acting to tax the exempt property, the governing body of the taxing unit must conduct a public hearing as required by Section 
1-n
(d), Article VIII, Texas Constitution.  If the governing body of a taxing unit provides for the taxation of the goods-in-transit as provided by this subsection, the exemption prescribed by Subsection (b) does not apply to that unit.  The goods-in-transit remain subject to taxation by the taxing unit until the governing body of the taxing unit, in the manner required for official action, rescinds or repeals its previous action to tax goods-in-transit, or otherwise determines that the exemption prescribed by Subsection (b) will apply to that taxing unit.
(j-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (j) or official action that was taken under that subsection before October 1, 2011, to tax goods-in-transit exempt under Subsection (b) and not exempt under other law, a taxing unit may not tax such goods-in-transit in a tax year that begins on or after January 1, 2012, unless the governing body of the taxing unit takes action on or after October 1, 2011, in the manner required for official action by the governing body, to provide for the taxation of the goods-in-transit.  The official action to tax the goods-in-transit must be taken before January 1 of the first tax year in which the governing body proposes to tax goods-in-transit.  Before acting to tax the exempt property, the governing body of the taxing unit must conduct a public hearing as required by Section 
1-n
(d), Article VIII, Texas Constitution.  If the governing body of a taxing unit provides for the taxation of the goods-in-transit as provided by this subsection, the exemption prescribed by Subsection (b) does not apply to that unit.  The goods-in-transit remain subject to taxation by the taxing unit until the governing body of the taxing unit, in the manner required for official action, rescinds or repeals its previous action to tax goods-in-transit or otherwise determines that the exemption prescribed by Subsection (b) will apply to that taxing unit.
(j-2)  Notwithstanding Subsection (j-1), if under Subsection (j) the governing body of a taxing unit, before October 1, 2011, took action to provide for the taxation of goods-in-transit and pledged the taxes imposed on the goods-in-transit for the payment of a debt of the taxing unit, the tax officials of the taxing unit may continue to impose the taxes against the goods-in-transit until the debt is discharged, if cessation of the imposition would impair the obligation of the contract by which the debt was created.
(k)  A property owner who receives the exemption from taxation provided by Subsection (b) is not eligible to receive the exemption from taxation provided by Section 
11.251
 for the same property.
(l)  This subsection applies only to a taxing unit any part of which is located in an area designated a disaster area by a disaster declaration issued under Section 
418.014
 or 
418.108
, Government Code, on or after January 1, 2020.  Notwithstanding Subsections (a)(2)(C), (e), and (g), the governing body of a taxing unit, in the manner provided by law for official action, may extend the date by which goods-in-transit must be transported to another location in this state or outside this state to a date not later than the 270th day after the date the person acquired the property in or imported the property into this state. An extension adopted by official action under this subsection applies only to:
(1)  the exemption from ad valorem taxation by the taxing unit adopting the extension; and
(2)  the tax year in which the extension is adopted.
(m)  This subsection and Subsection (l) expire December 31, 2025.

Sec. 11.26.  LIMITATION OF SCHOOL TAX ON HOMESTEADS OF ELDERLY OR DISABLED.  (a)  The tax officials shall appraise the property to which this section applies and calculate taxes as on other property, but if the tax so calculated exceeds the limitation imposed by this section, the tax imposed is the amount of the tax as limited by this section, except as otherwise provided by this section.  A school district may not increase the total annual amount of ad valorem tax it imposes on the residence homestead of an individual 65 years of age or older or on the residence homestead of an individual who is disabled, as defined by Section 
11.13
, above the amount of the tax it imposed in the first tax year in which the individual qualified that residence homestead for the applicable exemption provided by Section 
11.13
(c) for an individual who is 65 years of age or older or is disabled.  If the individual qualified that residence homestead for the exemption after the beginning of that first year and the residence homestead remains eligible for the same exemption for the next year, and if the school district taxes imposed on the residence homestead in the next year are less than the amount of taxes imposed in that first year, a school district may not subsequently increase the total annual amount of ad valorem taxes it imposes on the residence homestead above the amount it imposed in the year immediately following the first year for which the individual qualified that residence homestead for the same exemption, except as provided by Subsection (b).
(a-4)  In this section, "maximum compressed rate" means the maximum compressed rate of a school district as calculated under Section

(a-10)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if in the 2024 or a subsequent tax year an individual qualifies for a limitation on tax increases provided by this section on the individual's residence homestead, the amount of the limitation provided by this section on the homestead is equal to the amount computed by:
(1)  multiplying the taxable value of the homestead in the preceding tax year by a tax rate equal to the difference between the school district's maximum compressed rate for the preceding tax year and the district's maximum compressed rate for the current tax year;
(2)  subtracting the amount computed under Subdivision (1) from the amount of tax the district imposed on the homestead in the preceding tax year;
(3)  adding any tax imposed in the current tax year attributable to improvements made in the preceding tax year as provided by Subsection (b) to the amount computed under Subdivision (2);
(4)  multiplying the amount of any increase in the current tax year as compared to the preceding tax year in the aggregate amount of the exemptions to which the individual is entitled under Sections 
11.13
(b) and (c) by the school district's tax rate for the current tax year; and
(5)  subtracting the amount computed under Subdivision (4) from the amount computed under Subdivision (3).
(b)  If an individual makes improvements to the individual's residence homestead, other than improvements required to comply with governmental requirements or repairs, the school district may increase the tax on the homestead in the first year the value of the homestead is increased on the appraisal roll because of the enhancement of value by the improvements.  The amount of the tax increase is determined by applying the current tax rate to the difference in the assessed value of the homestead with the improvements and the assessed value it would have had without the improvements.  A limitation imposed by this section then applies to the increased amount of tax until more improvements, if any, are made.
(c)  The limitation on tax increases required by this section expires if on January 1:
(1)  none of the owners of the structure who qualify for the exemption and who owned the structure when the limitation first took effect is using the structure as a residence homestead;  or
(2)  none of the owners of the structure qualifies for the exemption.
(d)  If the appraisal roll provides for taxation of appraised value for a prior year because a residence homestead exemption for individuals 65 years of age or older or for disabled individuals was erroneously allowed, the tax assessor shall add, as back taxes due as provided by Section 
26.09
(d), the positive difference if any between the tax that should have been imposed for that year and the tax that was imposed because of the provisions of this section.
(e)  For each school district in an appraisal district, the chief appraiser shall determine the portion of the appraised value of residence homesteads of individuals on which school district taxes are not imposed in a tax year because of the limitation on tax increases imposed by this section.  That portion is calculated by determining the taxable value that, if multiplied by the tax rate adopted by the school district for the tax year, would produce an amount equal to the amount of tax that would have been imposed by the school district on those residence homesteads if the limitation on tax increases imposed by this section were not in effect, but that was not imposed because of that limitation.  The chief appraiser shall determine that taxable value and certify it to the comptroller as soon as practicable for each tax year.
(f)  The limitation on tax increases required by this section does not expire because the owner of an interest in the structure conveys the interest to a qualifying trust as defined by Section 
11.13
(j) if the owner or the owner's spouse is a trustor of the trust and is entitled to occupy the structure.
(g)  Except as provided by Subsection (b), if an individual who receives a limitation on tax increases imposed by this section, including a surviving spouse who receives a limitation under Subsection (i), subsequently qualifies a different residence homestead for the same exemption under Section 
11.13
, a school district may not impose ad valorem taxes on the subsequently qualified homestead in a year in an amount that exceeds the amount of taxes the school district would have imposed on the subsequently qualified homestead in the first year in which the individual receives that same exemption for the subsequently qualified homestead had the limitation on tax increases imposed by this section not been in effect, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the total amount of school district taxes imposed on the former homestead in the last year in which the individual received that same exemption for the former homestead and the denominator of which is the total amount of school district taxes that would have been imposed on the former homestead in the last year in which the individual received that same exemption for the former homestead had the limitation on tax increases imposed by this section not been in effect.
(h)  An individual who receives a limitation on tax increases under this section, including a surviving spouse who receives a limitation under Subsection (i), and who subsequently qualifies a different residence homestead for an exemption under Section 
11.13
, or an agent of the individual, is entitled to receive from the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the former homestead was located a written certificate providing the information necessary to determine whether the individual may qualify for that same limitation on the subsequently qualified homestead under Subsection (g) and to calculate the amount of taxes the school district may impose on the subsequently qualified homestead.
(i)  If an individual who qualifies for the exemption provided by Section 
11.13
(c) dies, the surviving spouse of the individual is entitled to the limitation applicable to the residence homestead of the individual if:
(1)  the surviving spouse is 55 years of age or older when the individual dies; and
(2)  the residence homestead of the individual:
(A)  is the residence homestead of the surviving spouse on the date that the individual dies; and
(B)  remains the residence homestead of the surviving spouse.
(i-1)  A limitation under Subsection (i) applicable to the residence homestead of the surviving spouse of an individual who was disabled and who died before January 1, 2020, is calculated as if the surviving spouse was entitled to the limitation when the individual died.
(j)  If an individual who qualifies for an exemption provided by Section 
11.13
(c) for an individual 65 years of age or older dies in the first year in which the individual qualified for the exemption and the individual first qualified for the exemption after the beginning of that year, except as provided by Subsection (k), the amount to which the surviving spouse's school district taxes are limited under Subsection (i) is the amount of school district taxes imposed on the residence homestead in that year determined as if the individual qualifying for the exemption had lived for the entire year.
(k)  If in the first tax year after the year in which an individual dies in the circumstances described by Subsection (j) the amount of school district taxes imposed on the residence homestead of the surviving spouse is less than the amount of school district taxes imposed in the preceding year as limited by Subsection (j), in a subsequent tax year the surviving spouse's school district taxes on that residence homestead are limited to the amount of taxes imposed by the district in that first tax year after the year in which the individual dies.
(l)  For the purpose of calculating a limitation on ad valorem tax increases by a school district under this section, an individual who qualified a residence homestead before January 1, 2003, for an exemption under Section 
11.13
(c) for a disabled individual is considered to have first qualified the homestead for that exemption on January 1, 2003.
(m)  For the purpose of qualifying under Subsection (g) for the limitation on ad valorem taxes on a subsequently qualified homestead imposed by a school district, the residence homestead of a disabled individual may be considered to be a subsequently qualified homestead only if the disabled individual qualified the former homestead for an exemption under Section 
11.13
(c) for a disabled individual for a tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2003.
(n)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c), the limitation on tax increases required by this section does not expire if the owner of the structure qualifies for an exemption under Section 
11.13
 under the circumstances described by Section 
11.135
(a).
(o)  Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (b), an improvement to property that would otherwise constitute an improvement under Subsection (b) is not treated as an improvement under that subsection if the improvement is a replacement structure for a structure that was rendered uninhabitable or unusable by a casualty or by wind or water damage.  For purposes of appraising the property in the tax year in which the structure would have constituted an improvement under Subsection (b), the replacement structure is considered to be an improvement under that subsection only if:
(1)  the square footage of the replacement structure exceeds that of the replaced structure as that structure existed before the casualty or damage occurred; or
(2)  the exterior of the replacement structure is of higher quality construction and composition than that of the replaced structure.
(p)  An heir property owner who qualifies heir property as the owner's residence homestead under this chapter is considered the sole owner of the property for the purposes of this section.

Sec. 11.261.  LIMITATION OF COUNTY, MUNICIPAL, OR JUNIOR COLLEGE DISTRICT TAX ON HOMESTEADS OF DISABLED AND ELDERLY.  (a)  This section applies only to a county, municipality, or junior college district that has established a limitation on the total amount of taxes that may be imposed by the county, municipality, or junior college district on the residence homestead of a disabled individual or an individual 65 years of age or older under Section 
1-b
(h), Article VIII, Texas Constitution.
(b)  The tax officials shall appraise the property to which the limitation applies and calculate taxes as on other property, but if the tax so calculated exceeds the limitation provided by this section, the tax imposed is the amount of the tax as limited by this section, except as otherwise provided by this section.  The county, municipality, or junior college district may not increase the total annual amount of ad valorem taxes the county, municipality, or junior college district imposes on the residence homestead of a disabled individual or an individual 65 years of age or older above the amount of the taxes the county, municipality, or junior college district imposed on the residence homestead in the first tax year, other than a tax year preceding the tax year in which the county, municipality, or junior college district established the limitation described by Subsection (a), in which the individual qualified that residence homestead for the exemption provided by Section 
11.13
(c) for a disabled individual or an individual 65 years of age or older.  If the individual qualified that residence homestead for the exemption after the beginning of that first year and the residence homestead remains eligible for the exemption for the next year, and if the county, municipal, or junior college district taxes imposed on the residence homestead in the next year are less than the amount of taxes imposed in that first year, a county, municipality, or junior college district may not subsequently increase the total annual amount of ad valorem taxes it imposes on the residence homestead above the amount it imposed on the residence homestead in the year immediately following the first year, other than a tax year preceding the tax year in which the county, municipality, or junior college district established the limitation described by Subsection (a), for which the individual qualified that residence homestead for the exemption.
(c)  If an individual makes improvements to the individual's residence homestead, other than repairs and other than improvements required to comply with governmental requirements, the county, municipality, or junior college district may increase the amount of taxes on the homestead in the first year the value of the homestead is increased on the appraisal roll because of the enhancement of value by the improvements.  The amount of the tax increase is determined by applying the current tax rate to the difference between the appraised value of the homestead with the improvements and the appraised value it would have had without the improvements.  A limitation provided by this section then applies to the increased amount of county, municipal, or junior college district taxes on the residence homestead until more improvements, if any, are made.
(d)  A limitation on county, municipal, or junior college district tax increases provided by this section expires if on January 1:
(1)  none of the owners of the structure who qualify for the exemption provided by Section 
11.13
(c) for a disabled individual or an individual 65 years of age or older and who owned the structure when the limitation provided by this section first took effect is using the structure as a residence homestead;  or
(2)  none of the owners of the structure qualifies for the exemption provided by Section 
11.13
(c) for a disabled individual or an individual 65 years of age or older.
(e)  If the appraisal roll provides for taxation of appraised value for a prior year because a residence homestead exemption for disabled individuals or individuals 65 years of age or older was erroneously allowed, the tax assessor for the applicable county, municipality, or junior college district shall add, as back taxes due as provided by Section 
26.09
(d), the positive difference, if any, between the tax that should have been imposed for that year and the tax that was imposed because of the provisions of this section.
(f)  A limitation on tax increases provided by this section does not expire because the owner of an interest in the structure conveys the interest to a qualifying trust as defined by Section 
11.13
(j) if the owner or the owner's spouse is a trustor of the trust and is entitled to occupy the structure.
(g)  Except as provided by Subsection (c), if an individual who receives a limitation on county, municipal, or junior college district tax increases provided by this section subsequently qualifies a different residence homestead in the same county, municipality, or junior college district for an exemption under Section 
11.13
, the county, municipality, or junior college district may not impose ad valorem taxes on the subsequently qualified homestead in a year in an amount that exceeds the amount of taxes the county, municipality, or junior college district would have imposed on the subsequently qualified homestead in the first year in which the individual receives that exemption for the subsequently qualified homestead had the limitation on tax increases provided by this section not been in effect, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the total amount of taxes the county, municipality, or junior college district imposed on the former homestead in the last year in which the individual received that exemption for the former homestead and the denominator of which is the total amount of taxes the county, municipality, or junior college district would have imposed on the former homestead in the last year in which the individual received that exemption for the former homestead had the limitation on tax increases provided by this section not been in effect.
(h)  An individual who receives a limitation on county, municipal, or junior college district tax increases under this section and who subsequently qualifies a different residence homestead in the same county, municipality, or junior college district for an exemption under Section 
11.13
, or an agent of the individual, is entitled to receive from the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the former homestead was located a written certificate providing the information necessary to determine whether the individual may qualify for a limitation on the subsequently qualified homestead under Subsection (g) and to calculate the amount of taxes the county, municipality, or junior college district may impose on the subsequently qualified homestead.
(i)  If an individual who qualifies for a limitation on county, municipal, or junior college district tax increases under this section dies, the surviving spouse of the individual is entitled to the limitation on taxes imposed by the county, municipality, or junior college district on the residence homestead of the individual if:
(1)  the surviving spouse is disabled or is 55 years of age or older when the individual dies;  and
(2)  the residence homestead of the individual:
(A)  is the residence homestead of the surviving spouse on the date that the individual dies;  and
(B)  remains the residence homestead of the surviving spouse.
(j)  If an individual who is 65 years of age or older and qualifies for a limitation on county, municipal, or junior college district tax increases for the elderly under this section dies in the first year in which the individual qualified for the limitation and the individual first qualified for the limitation after the beginning of that year, except as provided by Subsection (k), the amount to which the surviving spouse's county, municipal, or junior college district taxes are limited under Subsection (i) is the amount of taxes imposed by the county, municipality, or junior college district, as applicable, on the residence homestead in that year determined as if the individual qualifying for the exemption had lived for the entire year.
(k)  If in the first tax year after the year in which an individual who is 65 years of age or older dies under the circumstances described by Subsection (j) the amount of taxes imposed by a county, municipality, or junior college district on the residence homestead of the surviving spouse is less than the amount of taxes imposed by the county, municipality, or junior college district in the preceding year as limited by Subsection (j), in a subsequent tax year the surviving spouse's taxes imposed by the county, municipality, or junior college district on that residence homestead are limited to the amount of taxes imposed by the county, municipality, or junior college district in that first tax year after the year in which the individual dies.
(l)  Notwithstanding Subsection (d), a limitation on county, municipal, or junior college district tax increases provided by this section does not expire if the owner of the structure qualifies for an exemption under Section 
11.13
 under the circumstances described by Section 
11.135
(a).
(m)  Notwithstanding Subsections (b) and (c), an improvement to property that would otherwise constitute an improvement under Subsection (c) is not treated as an improvement under that subsection if the improvement is a replacement structure for a structure that was rendered uninhabitable or unusable by a casualty or by wind or water damage.  For purposes of appraising the property in the tax year in which the structure would have constituted an improvement under Subsection (c), the replacement structure is considered to be an improvement under that subsection only if:
(1)  the square footage of the replacement structure exceeds that of the replaced structure as that structure existed before the casualty or damage occurred; or
(2)  the exterior of the replacement structure is of higher quality construction and composition than that of the replaced structure.
(n)  An heir property owner who qualifies heir property as the owner's residence homestead under this chapter is considered the sole owner of the property for the purposes of this section.

(1)  a Level I damage assessment rating if the property is at least 15 percent, but less than 30 percent, damaged, meaning that the property suffered minimal damage and may continue to be used as intended;
(2)  a Level II damage assessment rating if the property is at least 30 percent, but less than 60 percent, damaged, which, for qualified property described by Subsection (a)(2)(A)(ii) or (iii), means that the property has suffered only nonstructural damage, including nonstructural damage to the roof, walls, foundation, or mechanical components, and the waterline, if any, is less than 18 inches above the floor;
(3)  a Level III damage assessment rating if the property is at least 60 percent damaged but is not a total loss, which, for qualified property described by Subsection (a)(2)(A)(ii) or (iii), means that the property has suffered significant structural damage requiring extensive repair due to the failure or partial failure of structural elements, wall elements, or the foundation, or the waterline is at least 18 inches above the floor; or
(4)  a Level IV damage assessment rating if the property is a total loss, meaning that repair of the property is not feasible.
(h)  Subject to Subsection (i), the amount of the exemption authorized by this section for an item of qualified property is determined by multiplying the appraised value, determined for the tax year in which the disaster occurred, of the property by:
(1)  15 percent, if the property is assigned a Level I damage assessment rating;
(2)  30 percent, if the property is assigned a Level II damage assessment rating;
(3)  60 percent, if the property is assigned a Level III damage assessment rating; or
(4)  100 percent, if the property is assigned a Level IV damage assessment rating.
(i)  If a person qualifies for the exemption authorized by this section after the beginning of the tax year, the amount of the exemption is calculated by multiplying the amount determined under Subsection (h) by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the tax year after the day on which the governor first declares the area in which the person's qualified property is located to be a disaster area, including the day on which the governor makes the declaration.
(j)  If a person qualifies for the exemption authorized by this section after the amount of the tax due on the qualified property is calculated and the effect of the qualification is to reduce the amount of the tax due on the property, the assessor for each applicable taxing unit shall recalculate the amount of the tax due on the property and correct the tax roll.  If the tax bill has been mailed and the tax on the property has not been paid, the assessor shall mail a corrected tax bill to the person in whose name the property is listed on the tax roll or to the person's authorized agent.  If the tax on the property has been paid, the tax collector for the taxing unit shall refund to the person who paid the tax the amount by which the payment exceeded the tax due.  No interest is due on an amount refunded under this subsection.
(k)  The exemption authorized by this section expires as to an item of qualified property on January 1 of the first tax year in which the property is reappraised under Section 
25.18
.

(2)  "Personal identification certificate" means a certificate issued by the Department of Public Safety under Subchapter 
E
, Chapter

(h)  If the chief appraiser learns of any reason indicating that an exemption previously allowed should be canceled, the chief appraiser shall investigate. Subject to Subsection (q), if the chief appraiser determines that the property should not be exempt, the chief appraiser shall cancel the exemption and deliver written notice of the cancellation within five days after the date the exemption is canceled.
(h-1)  The chief appraiser of an appraisal district shall develop a program for the periodic review of each residence homestead exemption granted by the district under Section 
11.13
 to confirm that the recipient of the exemption still qualifies for the exemption.  The program must require the chief appraiser to review each residence homestead exemption at least once every five tax years.  The program may provide for the review to take place in phases, with a portion of the exemptions reviewed in each tax year.
(i)  If the chief appraiser discovers that an exemption that is not required to be claimed annually has been erroneously allowed in any one of the five preceding years, the chief appraiser shall add the property or appraised value that was erroneously exempted for each year to the appraisal roll as provided by Section 
25.21
 of this code for other property that escapes taxation.  If an exemption that was erroneously allowed did not apply to all taxing units in which the property was located, the chief appraiser shall note on the appraisal records, for each prior year, the taxing units that gave the exemption and are entitled to impose taxes on the property or value that escaped taxation.
(j)  In addition to the items required by Subsection (f), an application for a residence homestead exemption prescribed by the comptroller and authorized by Section 
11.13

(1)  list each owner of the residence homestead and the interest of each owner;
(2)  state that the applicant does not claim an exemption under that section on another residence homestead in this state or claim a residence homestead exemption on a residence homestead outside this state;
(3)  state that each fact contained in the application is true;
(4)  include a copy of the applicant's driver's license or state-issued personal identification certificate unless the applicant:

B
, Chapter 
58

(5)  state that the applicant has read and understands the notice of the penalties required by Subsection (f); and
(6)  be signed by the applicant.
(k)  A person who qualifies for an exemption authorized by Section 
11.13
(c) or (d) or 
11.132
 must apply for the exemption no later than the first anniversary of the date the person qualified for the exemption.
(l)  The form for an application under Section 
11.13
 must include a space for the applicant to state the applicant's date of birth and, if applicable, the date of birth of the applicant's spouse.  Failure to provide the applicant's date of birth does not affect the applicant's eligibility for an exemption under that section, other than an exemption under Section 
11.13
(c) or (d) for an individual 65 years of age or older.   Failure to provide the date of birth of the applicant's spouse does not affect the applicant's eligibility for an exemption under Section 
11.13
 or the applicant's spouse's eligibility for an exemption under that section, other than an exemption under Section 
11.13
(q) for the surviving spouse of an individual 65 years of age or older.
(m)  Notwithstanding Subsections (a) and (k), if a person who receives an exemption under Section 
11.13
, other than an exemption under Section 
11.13
(c) or (d) for an individual 65 years of age or older, in a tax year becomes 65 years of age in the next tax year, the person is entitled to receive and the chief appraiser shall allow an exemption under Section 
11.13
(c) or (d) for an individual 65 years of age or older in that next tax year on the same property without requiring the person to apply for or otherwise request the exemption if the person's age is shown by:
(1)  information in the records of the appraisal district that was provided to the appraisal district by the individual in an application for an exemption under Section 
11.13
 on the property or in correspondence relating to the property; or
(2)  the information provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety to the appraisal district under Section 
521.049
, Transportation Code.
(m-1)  Subsection (m) does not apply if the chief appraiser determines that the individual is no longer entitled to any exemption under Section 
11.13
 on the property.
(m-2)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), if a person who receives an exemption under Section 
11.13
(d) for an individual 65 years of age or older dies in a tax year, that person's surviving spouse is entitled to receive an exemption under Section 
11.13
(q) in the next tax year on the same property without applying for the exemption if:
(1)  the appraisal district learns of the person's death from any source, including the death records maintained by the vital statistics unit of the Department of State Health Services or a local registration official; and
(2)  the surviving spouse is otherwise eligible to receive the exemption as shown by:
(A)  information in the records of the appraisal district that was provided to the appraisal district in an application for an exemption under Section 
11.13
 on the property or in correspondence relating to the property; or
(B)  information provided by the Texas Department of Public Safety to the appraisal district under Section 
521.049
, Transportation Code.
(m-3)  Subsection (m-2) does not apply if the chief appraiser determines that the surviving spouse is no longer entitled to any exemption under Section 
11.13
 on the property.
(n)  Except as provided by Subsection (p), a chief appraiser may not allow an applicant an exemption provided by Section 
11.13
 if the applicant is required under Subsection (j) to provide a copy of the applicant's driver's license or state-issued personal identification certificate unless  the address listed on the driver's license or state-issued personal identification certificate provided by the applicant corresponds to the address of the property for which the exemption is claimed.
(o)  The application form for a residence homestead exemption must require an applicant who is not specifically identified on a deed or other appropriate instrument recorded in the real property records of the county in which the property is located as an owner of the residence homestead, including an heir property owner, to provide:
(1)  an affidavit establishing the applicant's ownership of an interest in the property;
(2)  a copy of the death certificate of the prior owner of the property, if the applicant is an heir property owner;
(3)  a copy of the most recent utility bill for the property, if the applicant is an heir property owner; and
(4)  a citation of any court record relating to the applicant's ownership of the property if available.
(o-1)  The application form for a residence homestead exemption may not require an heir property owner to provide a copy of an instrument recorded in the real property records of the county in which the property is located.
(o-2)  The application form for a residence homestead exemption must require:
(1)  an applicant who is an heir property owner to state that the property for which the application is submitted is heir property; and
(2)  each owner of an interest in heir property who occupies the property as the owner's principal residence, other than the applicant, to provide an affidavit that authorizes the submission of the application.
(p)  A chief appraiser may waive the requirement provided by Subsection (n) that the address of the property for which the exemption is claimed correspond to the address listed on the driver's license or state-issued personal identification certificate provided by the applicant under Subsection (j) if the applicant:
(1)  is an active duty member of the armed services of the United States or the spouse of an active duty member and the applicant includes with the application a copy of the applicant's or spouse's military identification card and a copy of a utility bill for the property subject to the claimed exemption in the applicant's or spouse's name; or
(2)  holds a driver's license issued under Section 
521.121
(c) or 
521.1211
, Transportation Code, and includes with the application a copy of the application for that license provided to the Texas Department of Transportation.
(q)  A chief appraiser may not cancel an exemption under Section 
11.13
 that is received by an individual who is 65 years of age or older without first providing written notice of the cancellation to the individual receiving the exemption.  The notice must include a form on which the individual may indicate whether the individual is qualified to receive the exemption and a self-addressed postage prepaid envelope with instructions for returning the form to the chief appraiser. The chief appraiser shall consider the individual's response on the form in determining whether to continue to allow the exemption. If the chief appraiser does not receive a response on or before the 60th day after the date the notice is mailed, the chief appraiser may cancel the exemption on or after the 30th day after the expiration of the 60-day period, but only after making a reasonable effort to locate the individual and determine whether the individual is qualified to receive the exemption. For purposes of this subsection, sending an additional notice of cancellation that includes, in bold font equal to or greater in size than the surrounding text, the date on which the chief appraiser is authorized to cancel the exemption to the individual receiving the exemption immediately after the expiration of the 60-day period by first class mail in an envelope on which is written, in all capital letters, "RETURN SERVICE REQUESTED," or another appropriate statement directing the United States Postal Service to return the notice if it is not deliverable as addressed, or providing the additional notice in another manner that the chief appraiser determines is appropriate, constitutes a reasonable effort on the part of the chief appraiser. This subsection does not apply to an exemption under Section 
11.13
(c) or (d) for an individual 65 years of age or older that is canceled because the chief appraiser determines that the individual receiving the exemption no longer owns the property subject to the exemption.
(r)  The chief appraiser may not require a person allowed an exemption under Section 
11.131
 to file a new application to determine the person's current qualification for the exemption if the person has a permanent total disability determined by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs under 38 C.F.R. Section 4.15.
(s)  A person who qualifies for an exemption under Section 
11.35
(b) must apply for the exemption not later than the 105th day after the date the governor declares the area in which the person's qualified property is located to be a disaster area.   The chief appraiser may extend the deadline prescribed by this subsection for good cause shown.

(b)  The appraisal office shall make the allocation as provided by Subsections (b-1), (b-2), and (b-3).
(b-1)  Except as provided by Subsection (b-2), the allocable portion of the total fair market value of a vessel or other watercraft used as an instrumentality of commerce that is taxable in this state is determined by multiplying the total fair market value by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of miles the vessel or watercraft was operated in this state during the year preceding the tax year and the denominator of which is the total number of miles the vessel or watercraft was operated during the year preceding the tax year.

21.02
 and 
21.021
, a property owner that elects to have the appraisal office make the allocation of the property owner's fleet under this subsection may designate the location of the property owner's principal place of business as the taxable situs of the fleet.
(b-3)  The allocable portion of the total fair market value of a special-purpose vessel or other watercraft not used as an instrumentality of commerce is determined by multiplying the total fair market value by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the vessel or watercraft was physically located in this state during the year preceding the tax year and the denominator of which is 365.

(1)  the allocation formula specified in this section is arbitrary and unreasonable as applied to the vessel or watercraft;  and
(2)  the formula or indication of use proposed by the property owner or appraisal office more fairly reflects the vessel or watercraft's use in this state than that specified in this section.
(e)  To receive an allocation of value under this section, a property owner must apply for the allocation on a form that substantially complies with the form prescribed by the comptroller.  The application must be filed with the chief appraiser for the district in which the property to which the application applies is taxable before the approval of the appraisal records by the appraisal review board as provided by Section

CHAPTER 23. APPRAISAL METHODS AND PROCEDURES
SUBCHAPTER A. APPRAISALS GENERALLY
Sec. 23.01.  APPRAISALS GENERALLY.  (a)  Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, all taxable property is appraised at its market value as of January 1.
(b)  The market value of property shall be determined by the application of generally accepted appraisal methods and techniques.  If the appraisal district determines the appraised value of a property using mass appraisal standards, the mass appraisal standards must comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice.  The same or similar appraisal methods and techniques shall be used in appraising the same or similar kinds of property.  However, each property shall be appraised based upon the individual characteristics that affect the property's market value, and all available evidence that is specific to the value of the property shall be taken into account in determining the property's market value.
(c)  Notwithstanding Section 
1.04
(7)(C), in determining the market value of a residence homestead, the chief appraiser may not exclude from consideration the value of other residential property that is in the same neighborhood as the residence homestead being appraised and would otherwise be considered in appraising the residence homestead because the other residential property:
(1)  was sold at a foreclosure sale conducted in any of the three years preceding the tax year in which the residence homestead is being appraised and was comparable at the time of sale based on relevant characteristics with other residence homesteads in the same neighborhood; or
(2)  has a market value that has declined because of a declining economy.
(d)  The market value of a residence homestead shall be determined solely on the basis of the property's value as a residence homestead, regardless of whether the residential use of the property by the owner is considered to be the highest and best use of the property.
(e)  Notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter to the contrary, if the appraised value of property in a tax year is lowered under Subtitle F, the appraised value of the property as finally determined under that subtitle is considered to be the appraised value of the property for that tax year.  In the next tax year in which the property is appraised, the chief appraiser may not increase the appraised value of the property unless the increase by the chief appraiser is reasonably supported by clear and convincing evidence when all of the reliable and probative evidence in the record is considered as a whole.  If the appraised value is finally determined in a protest under Section 
41.41
(a)(2) or an appeal under Section 
42.26
, the chief appraiser may satisfy the requirement to reasonably support by clear and convincing evidence an increase in the appraised value of the property in the next tax year in which the property is appraised by presenting evidence showing that the inequality in the appraisal of property has been corrected with regard to the properties that were considered in determining the value of the subject property.  The burden of proof is on the chief appraiser to support an increase in the appraised value of property under the circumstances described by this subsection.
(f)  The selection of comparable properties and the application of appropriate adjustments for the determination of an appraised value of property by any person under Section 
41.43
(b)(3) or 
42.26
(a)(3) must be based on the application of generally accepted appraisal methods and techniques.  Adjustments must be based on recognized methods and techniques that are necessary to produce a credible opinion.
(g)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, property owners representing themselves are entitled to offer an opinion of and present argument and evidence related to the market and appraised value or the inequality of appraisal of the owner's property.
(h)  Appraisal methods and techniques included in the most recent versions of the following are considered generally accepted appraisal methods and techniques for the purposes of this title:
(1)  the Appraisal of Real Estate published by the Appraisal Institute;
(2)  the Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal published by the Appraisal Institute;
(3)  the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice published by The Appraisal Foundation; and
(4)  a publication that includes information related to mass appraisal.

(3)  make available to the public on request cost data developed and used by the chief appraiser as applied to all properties within a property category and may charge a reasonable fee to the public for the data;
(4)  clearly state the reason for any variation between generally accepted cost data and locally produced cost data if the data vary by more than 10 percent;  and
(5)  make available to the property owner on request all applicable market data that demonstrate the difference between the replacement cost of the improvements to the property and the depreciated value of the improvements.

Sec. 23.012.  INCOME METHOD OF APPRAISAL.  (a)  If the income method of appraisal is the most appropriate method to use to determine the market value of real property, the chief appraiser shall:
(1)  analyze comparable rental data available to the chief appraiser or the potential earnings capacity of the property, or both, to estimate the gross income potential of the property;
(2)  analyze comparable operating expense data available to the chief appraiser to estimate the operating expenses of the property;
(3)  analyze comparable data available to the chief appraiser to estimate rates of capitalization or rates of discount;  and
(4)  base projections of future rent or income potential and expenses on reasonably clear and appropriate evidence.
(b)  In developing income and expense statements and cash-flow projections, the chief appraiser shall consider:
(1)  historical information and trends;
(2)  current supply and demand factors affecting those trends;  and
(3)  anticipated events such as competition from other similar properties under construction.

Sec. 23.013.  MARKET DATA COMPARISON METHOD OF APPRAISAL.  (a)  If the chief appraiser uses the market data comparison method of appraisal to determine the market value of real property, the chief appraiser shall use comparable sales data and shall adjust the comparable sales to the subject property.
(b)  A sale is not considered to be a comparable sale unless the sale occurred within 24 months of the date as of which the market value of the subject property is to be determined, except that a sale that did not occur during that period may be considered to be a comparable sale if enough comparable properties were not sold during that period to constitute a representative sample.
(b-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b), for a residential property in a county with a population of more than 150,000, a sale is not considered to be a comparable sale unless the sale occurred within 36 months of the date as of which the market value of the subject property is to be determined, regardless of the number of comparable properties sold during that period.
(c)  A sale of a comparable property must be appropriately adjusted for any change in the market value of the comparable property during the period between the date of the sale of the comparable property and the date as of which the market value of the subject property is to be determined.
(d)  Whether a property is comparable to the subject property shall be determined based on similarities with regard to location, square footage of the lot and improvements, property age, property condition, property access, amenities, views, income, operating expenses, occupancy, and the existence of easements, deed restrictions, or other legal burdens affecting marketability.
(e)  In this subsection, "designated historic district" means an area that is zoned or otherwise designated as a historic district under municipal, state, or federal law.  In determining the market value of residential real property located in a designated historic district, the chief appraiser shall consider the effect on the property's value of any restriction placed by the historic district on the property owner's ability to alter, improve, or repair the property.

For purposes of this subsection, a dealer is presumed to have commenced business on the date of issuance to the dealer of a dealer's general distinguishing number as provided by Chapter 
503
, Transportation Code.  Notwithstanding the presumption created by this subsection, a chief appraiser may, at his or her sole discretion, designate as the date on which a dealer commenced business a date other than the date of issuance to the dealer of a dealer's general distinguishing number.  The declaration is sufficient to comply with this subsection if it sets forth the following information:
(1)  the name and business address of each location at which the dealer owner conducts business;
(2)  each of the dealer's general distinguishing numbers issued by the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles;
(3)  a statement that the dealer owner is the owner of a dealer's motor vehicle inventory; and
(4)  the market value of the dealer's motor vehicle inventory for the current tax year as computed under Section 
23.121
(b).
(g)  Under the terms provided by this subsection, the chief appraiser may examine the books and records of the holder of a general distinguishing number issued by the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles.  A request made under this subsection must be made in writing, delivered personally to the custodian of the records, at the location for which the general distinguishing number has been issued, must provide a period not less than 15 days for the person to respond to the request, and must state that the person to whom it is addressed has the right to seek judicial relief from compliance with the request.  In a request made under this section the chief appraiser may examine:
(1)  the document issued by the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles showing the person's general distinguishing number;
(2)  documentation appropriate to allow the chief appraiser to ascertain the applicability of this section and Section 
23.122
 to the person;
(3)  sales records to substantiate information set forth in the dealer's declaration filed by the person.
(h)  If a dealer fails to file a declaration as required by this section, the chief appraiser may report the dealer to the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles to initiate cancellation of the dealer's general distinguishing number.  The chief appraiser shall include with the report written verification that the chief appraiser informed the dealer of the requirement to file a declaration under this section.
(h-1)  If, on the declaration required by this section, a dealer reports the sale of fewer than five motor vehicles in the prior year, the chief appraiser shall report the dealer to the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles to initiate cancellation of the dealer's general distinguishing number.

The unit property tax of each motor vehicle is determined by multiplying the sales price of the motor vehicle by the unit property tax factor.  On or before the 10th day of each month the owner shall, together with the statement filed by the owner as required by this section, deposit with the collector a sum equal to the total of unit property tax assigned to all motor vehicles sold from the dealer's motor vehicle inventory in the prior month to which a unit property tax was assigned.

(d)  The owner may not withdraw funds in an escrow account created pursuant to this section.
(e)  The comptroller shall promulgate a form entitled a Dealer's Motor Vehicle Inventory Tax Statement.  Each month, a dealer shall complete the form regardless of whether a motor vehicle is sold.  A dealer may use no other form for that purpose.  The statement may include the information the comptroller deems appropriate but shall include at least the following:

(3)  the unit property tax of the motor vehicle if any; and
(4)  the reason no unit property tax is assigned if no unit property tax is assigned.
(f)  On or before the 10th day of each month a dealer shall file with the collector the statement covering the sale of each motor vehicle sold by the dealer in the prior month.  On or before the 10th day of a month following a month in which a dealer does not sell a motor vehicle, the dealer must file the statement with the collector and indicate that no sales were made in the prior month.  A dealer shall file a copy of the statement with the chief appraiser and retain documentation relating to the disposition of each motor vehicle sold.  A chief appraiser or collector may examine documents held by a dealer as required by this subsection in the same manner, and subject to the same provisions, as are set forth in Section 
23.121
(g).
(g)  The requirements of Subsection (f) of this section apply to all dealers, without regard to whether or not the dealer owes vehicle inventory tax for the current year.  A dealer who owes no vehicle inventory tax for the current year because he was not in business on January 1 may neither assign a unit property tax to a motor vehicle sold by the dealer nor remit money with the statement unless pursuant to the terms of a contract as provided by Subsection (l) of this section.
(h)  A collector may establish a procedure, voluntary or mandatory, by which the unit property tax of a vehicle is paid and deposited into an owner's escrow account at the time of processing the transfer of title to the motor vehicle.
(i)  A relevant taxing unit shall, on its tax bill prepared for the owner of a dealer's motor vehicle inventory, separately itemize the taxes levied against the dealer's motor vehicle inventory.  When the tax bill is prepared by a relevant taxing unit for a dealer's motor vehicle inventory, the assessor for the relevant taxing unit, or an entity, if any, other than the collector, that collects taxes on behalf of the taxing unit, shall provide the collector a true and correct copy of the tax bill sent to the owner, including taxes levied against the dealer's motor vehicle inventory.  The collector shall apply the money in the owner's escrow account to the taxes imposed and deliver a tax receipt to the owner.  The collector shall apply the amount to each relevant taxing unit in proportion to the amount of taxes levied, and the assessor of each relevant taxing unit shall apply the funds received from the collector to the taxes owed by the owner.
(j)  If the amount in the escrow account is not sufficient to pay the taxes in full, the collector shall apply the money to the taxes and deliver to the owner a tax receipt for the partial payment and a tax bill for the amount of the deficiency together with a statement that the owner must remit to the collector the balance of the total tax due.
(k)  The collector shall remit to each relevant taxing unit the total amount collected by the collector in deficiency payments.  The assessor of each relevant taxing unit shall apply those funds to the taxes owed by the owner.  Taxes that are due but not received by the collector on or before January 31 are delinquent.  Not later than February 15 the collector shall distribute to relevant taxing units in the manner set forth in this section all funds collected pursuant to the authority of this section and held in escrow by the collector as provided by this section.  This section does not impose a duty on a collector to collect delinquent taxes that the collector is not otherwise obligated by law or contract to collect.
(l)  A person who acquires the business or assets of an owner may, by contract, agree to pay the current year vehicle inventory taxes owed by the owner.  The owner who owes the current year tax and the person who acquires the business or assets of the owner shall jointly notify the chief appraiser and the collector of the terms of the agreement and of the fact that the purchaser has agreed to pay the current year vehicle inventory taxes owed by the selling dealer.  The chief appraiser and the collector shall adjust their records accordingly.  Notwithstanding the terms of Section 
23.121
 of this code, a person who agrees to pay current year vehicle inventory taxes as provided by this subsection is not required to file a declaration until the year following the acquisition.  This subsection does not relieve the selling owner of tax liability.
(m)  A dealer who fails to file a statement as required by this section commits an offense.  An offense under this subsection is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $100.  Each day during which a dealer fails to comply with the terms of this subsection is a separate violation.
(n)  In addition to other penalties provided by law, a dealer who fails to file or fails to timely file a statement as required by this section shall forfeit a penalty.  A tax lien attaches to the dealer's business personal property to secure payment of the penalty.  The appropriate district attorney, criminal district attorney, county attorney, collector, or person designated by the collector shall collect the penalty established by this section in the name of the collector.  Venue of an action brought under this subsection is in the county in which the violation occurred or in the county in which the owner maintains the owner's principal place of business or residence.  A penalty forfeited under this subsection is $500 for each month or part of a month in which a statement is not filed or timely filed after it is due.
(o)  An owner who fails to remit unit property taxes due as required by this section shall pay a penalty of five percent of the amount due.  If the amount is not paid within 10 days after the due date, the owner shall pay an additional penalty of five percent of the amount due.  Notwithstanding the terms of this section, unit property taxes paid on or before January 31 of the year following the date on which they are due are not delinquent.  The collector, the collector's designated agent, or the county or district attorney shall enforce the terms of this subsection.  A penalty under this subsection is in addition to any other penalty provided by law if the owner's taxes are delinquent.
(p)  Fines collected pursuant to the authority of this section shall be deposited in the county depository to the credit of the general fund.  Penalties collected pursuant to the authority of this section are the sole property of the collector, may be used by no entity other than the collector, and may not be used to reduce or otherwise affect the annual appropriation to the collector that would otherwise be made.

(8)  "Subsequent sale" means a dealer-financed sale of an item of heavy equipment that, at the time of the sale, has been the subject of a dealer-financed sale from the same dealer's heavy equipment inventory in the same calendar year.  The term does not include a rental or lease with an unexercised purchase option or without a purchase option.
(9)  "Total annual sales" means the total of the:
(A)  sales price for each sale from a dealer's heavy equipment inventory in a 12-month period; and
(B)  lease and rental payments received for each lease or rental of heavy equipment inventory in a 12-month period.
(b)  For the purpose of the computation of property tax,  the market value of a dealer's heavy equipment inventory on January 1 is the total annual sales, less sales to dealers, fleet transactions, and subsequent sales, for the 12-month period corresponding to the preceding tax year, divided by 12.
(b-1)  For the purpose of the computation of property tax on the market value of the dealer's heavy equipment inventory, the sales price of an item of heavy equipment that is sold during the preceding tax year after being leased or rented for a portion of that same tax year is considered to be the sum of the sales price of the item plus the total lease and rental payments received for the item in the preceding tax year.
(c)  For the purpose of the computation of property tax on the market value of the dealer's heavy equipment inventory of an owner who was not a dealer on January 1 of the preceding tax year, the chief appraiser shall estimate the market value of the dealer's heavy equipment inventory.  In making the estimate required by this subsection, the chief appraiser shall extrapolate using sales data, if any, generated by sales from the dealer's heavy equipment inventory in the preceding tax year.
(d)  Except for dealer's heavy equipment inventory, personal property held by a dealer is appraised as provided by the other sections of this code.  In the case of a dealer whose sales from the dealer's heavy equipment inventory are made predominately to other dealers, the chief appraiser shall appraise the dealer's heavy equipment inventory as provided by Section 
23.12
.
(e)  A dealer is presumed to be an owner of a dealer's heavy equipment inventory on January 1 if, in the 12-month period ending on December 31 of the preceding year, the dealer sold, leased, or rented an item of heavy equipment to a person other than a dealer.  The presumption is not rebutted by the fact that a dealer has no item of heavy equipment physically on hand for sale from the dealer's heavy equipment inventory on January 1.
(f)  The comptroller by rule shall adopt a dealer's heavy equipment inventory declaration form.  Except as provided by Section 
23.1242
(k), not later than February 1 of each year, or, in the case of a dealer who was not in business on January 1, not later than 30 days after commencement of business, each dealer shall file a declaration with the chief appraiser and file a copy with the collector.  The declaration is sufficient to comply with this subsection if it sets forth:
(1)  the name and business address of each location at which the declarant conducts business;
(2)  a statement that the declarant is the owner of a dealer's heavy equipment inventory;  and
(3)  the market value of the declarant's heavy equipment inventory for the current tax year as computed under Subsection (b).
(g)  As provided by this subsection, the chief appraiser may examine the books and records of a dealer.  A request made under this subsection must be made in writing, must be delivered personally to the custodian of the records at a location at which the dealer conducts business, must provide a period of not less than 15 days for the person to respond to the request, and must state that the person to whom the request is addressed has the right to seek judicial relief from compliance with the request.  In a request made under this section, the chief appraiser may examine:
(1)  documentation appropriate to allow the chief appraiser to ascertain the applicability of this section and Section 
23.1242
 to the person;  and
(2)  sales records to substantiate information set forth in the declaration filed by the dealer.

(i)  Repealed by Acts 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., Ch. 322, Sec. 8, eff. January 1, 2012.
(j)  In addition to other penalties provided by law, a dealer who fails to file or fails to timely file a declaration required by Subsection (f) shall forfeit a penalty.  A tax lien attaches to the dealer's business personal property to secure payment of the penalty.  The appropriate district attorney, criminal district attorney, or county attorney may collect the penalty established by this section in the name of the collector.  The chief appraiser may collect the penalty in the name of the chief appraiser.  The chief appraiser or the appropriate district attorney, criminal district attorney, or county attorney may sue to enforce compliance with this section.  Venue of an action brought under this subsection, including an action for injunctive relief, is in the county in which the violation occurred or in the county in which the owner maintains the owner's principal place of business or residence.  The court may award attorney's fees to a chief appraiser, district attorney, criminal district attorney, or county attorney who prevails in a suit to collect a penalty or enforce compliance with this section.

Sec. 23.1242.  PREPAYMENT OF TAXES BY HEAVY EQUIPMENT DEALERS.  (a)  In this section:
(1)  "Aggregate tax rate" means the combined tax rates of all appropriate taxing units authorized by law to levy property taxes against a dealer's heavy equipment inventory.
(2)  "Dealer's heavy equipment inventory," "declaration," "dealer," "sales price," "subsequent sale," and "total annual sales" have the meanings assigned those terms by Section 
23.1241
.
(3)  "Statement" means the dealer's heavy equipment inventory tax statement filed on a form adopted by the comptroller under this section.
(4)  "Unit property tax factor" means a number equal to one-twelfth of the preceding year's aggregate ad valorem tax rate at the location where a dealer's heavy equipment inventory is located on January 1 of the current year.
(b)  Except for an item of heavy equipment sold to a dealer, an item of heavy equipment included in a fleet transaction, an item of heavy equipment that is the subject of a subsequent sale, or an item of heavy equipment that is subject to a lease or rental, an owner or a person who has agreed by contract to pay the owner's current year property taxes levied against the owner's heavy equipment inventory shall assign a unit property tax to each item of heavy equipment sold from a dealer's heavy equipment inventory.  In the case of a lease or rental, the owner shall assign a unit property tax to each item of heavy equipment leased or rented.  The unit property tax of each item of heavy equipment is determined by multiplying the sales price of the item or the monthly lease or rental payment received for the item, as applicable, by the unit property tax factor.  If the transaction is a lease or rental, the owner shall collect the unit property tax from the lessee or renter at the time the lessee or renter submits payment for the lease or rental.  The owner of the equipment shall state the amount of the unit property tax assigned as a separate line item on an invoice.  On or before the 20th day of each month the owner shall, together with the statement filed by the owner as required by this section, deposit with the collector an amount equal to the total of unit property tax assigned to all items of heavy equipment sold, leased, or rented from the dealer's heavy equipment inventory in the preceding month to which a unit property tax was assigned.  The money shall be deposited by the collector to the credit of the owner's escrow account for prepayment of property taxes as provided by this section.  An escrow account required by this section is used to pay property taxes levied against the dealer's heavy equipment inventory, and the owner shall fund the escrow account as provided by this subsection.
(c)  The collector shall maintain the escrow account for each owner in the county depository.  The collector is not required to maintain a separate account in the depository for each escrow account created as provided by this section but shall maintain separate records for each owner.  The collector shall retain any interest generated by the escrow account to defray the cost of administration of the prepayment procedure established by this section.  Interest generated by an escrow account created as provided by this section is the sole property of the collector and that interest may not be used by an entity other than the collector.  Interest generated by an escrow account may not be used to reduce or otherwise affect the annual appropriation to the collector that would otherwise be made.
(d)  Except as provided by Section 
23.1243
, the owner may not withdraw funds in an escrow account created under this section.
(e)  The comptroller by rule shall adopt a dealer's heavy equipment inventory tax statement form.  Each month, a dealer shall complete the form regardless of whether an item of heavy equipment is sold, leased, or rented.  A dealer may use no other form for that purpose.  The statement may include the information the comptroller considers appropriate but shall include at least the following:
(1)  a description of each item of heavy equipment sold, leased, or rented including any unique identification or serial number affixed to the item by the manufacturer;
(2)  the sales price of or lease or rental payment received for the item of heavy equipment, as applicable;
(3)  the unit property tax of the item of heavy equipment, if any; and
(4)  the reason no unit property tax is assigned if no unit property tax is assigned.
(f)  On or before the 20th day of each month, a dealer shall file with the collector the statement covering the sale, lease, or rental of each item of heavy equipment sold, leased, or rented by the dealer in the preceding month.  On or before the 20th day of a month following a month in which a dealer does not sell, lease, or rent an item of heavy equipment, the dealer must file the statement with the collector and indicate that no sales, leases, or rentals were made in the prior month.  A dealer shall file a copy of the statement with the chief appraiser and retain documentation relating to the disposition of each item of heavy equipment sold and the lease or rental of each item of heavy equipment.  A chief appraiser or collector may examine documents held by a dealer as provided by this subsection in the same manner, and subject to the same conditions, as provided by Section 
23.1241
(g).
(g)  Except as provided by this subsection, Subsection (f) applies to any dealer, regardless of whether a dealer owes heavy equipment inventory tax for the current year.  A dealer who owes no heavy equipment inventory tax for the current year because the dealer was not in business on January 1:
(1)  shall file the statement required by this section showing the information required by this section for each month that the dealer is in business;  and
(2)  may not assign a unit property tax to an item of heavy equipment sold by the dealer or remit money with the statement except in compliance with the terms of a contract as provided by Subsection (k).
(h)  A taxing unit shall, on its tax bill prepared for the owner of a dealer's heavy equipment inventory, separately itemize the taxes levied against the dealer's heavy equipment inventory.  When the tax bill is prepared for a dealer's heavy equipment inventory, the assessor for the taxing unit, or an entity, if any, other than the collector, that collects taxes on behalf of the taxing unit, shall provide the collector a true and correct copy of the tax bill sent to the owner, including taxes levied against the dealer's heavy equipment inventory.  The collector shall apply the money in the owner's escrow account to the taxes imposed and deliver a tax receipt to the owner.  The collector shall apply the amount to each appropriate taxing unit in proportion to the amount of taxes levied, and the assessor of each taxing unit shall apply the funds received from the collector to the taxes owed by the owner.
(i)  If the amount in the escrow account is not sufficient to pay the taxes in full, the collector shall apply the money to the taxes and deliver to the owner a tax receipt for the partial payment and a tax bill for the amount of the deficiency together with a statement that the owner must remit to the collector the balance of the total tax due.
(j)  The collector shall remit to each appropriate taxing unit the total amount collected by the collector in deficiency payments.  The assessor of each taxing unit shall apply those funds to the taxes owed by the owner.  Taxes that are due but not received by the collector on or before January 31 are delinquent.  Not later than February 15, the collector shall distribute to each appropriate taxing unit in the manner provided by this section all funds collected under authority of this section and held in escrow by the collector under this section.  This section does not impose a duty on a collector to collect delinquent taxes that the collector is not otherwise obligated by law or contract to collect.
(k)  A person who acquires the business or assets of an owner may, by contract, agree to pay the current year heavy equipment inventory taxes owed by the owner.  The owner who owes the current year tax and the person who acquires the business or assets of the owner shall jointly notify the chief appraiser and the collector of the terms of the agreement and of the fact that the other person has agreed to pay the current year heavy equipment inventory taxes owed by the dealer.  The chief appraiser and the collector shall adjust their records accordingly.  Notwithstanding Section 
23.1241
, a person who agrees to pay current year heavy equipment inventory taxes as provided by this subsection is not required to file a declaration until the year following the acquisition.  This subsection does not relieve the selling owner of the tax liability.
(l)  Repealed by Acts 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., Ch. 322, Sec. 8, eff. January 1, 2012.
(m)  In addition to other penalties provided by law, a dealer who fails to file or fails to timely file a statement as required by this section shall forfeit a penalty.  A tax lien attaches to the dealer's business personal property to secure payment of the penalty.  The appropriate district attorney, criminal district attorney, or county attorney may collect the penalty established by this section in the name of the collector.  The chief appraiser may collect the penalty in the name of the chief appraiser.  The chief appraiser or the appropriate district attorney, criminal district attorney, or county attorney may sue to enforce compliance with this section.  Venue of an action brought under this subsection, including an action for injunctive relief, is in the county in which the violation occurred or in the county in which the owner maintains the owner's principal place of business or residence.  The court may award attorney's fees to a chief appraiser, district attorney, criminal district attorney, or county attorney who prevails in a suit to collect a penalty or enforce compliance with this section.  A penalty forfeited under this subsection is $500 for each month or part of a month in which a statement is not filed or timely filed after it is due.
(n)  An owner who fails to remit unit property taxes due as required by this section shall pay a penalty of five percent of the amount due.  If the amount is not paid within 10 days after the due date, the owner shall pay an additional penalty of five percent of the amount due.  Notwithstanding this section, unit property taxes paid on or before January 31 of the year following the date on which they are due are not delinquent.  The collector, the collector's designated agent, or the county or district attorney shall enforce this subsection.  A penalty under this subsection is in addition to any other penalty provided by law if the owner's taxes are delinquent.
(o)  A fine collected under this section shall be deposited in the county depository to the credit of the general fund.  A penalty collected under this section is the sole property of the collector, may be used by no entity other than the collector, and may not be used to reduce or otherwise affect the annual appropriation to the collector that would otherwise be made.
(p)  Section 
23.123
 applies to a declaration or statement filed under this section in the same manner in which that section applies to a statement or declaration filed as required by Section 
23.121
 or 
23.122

Sec. 23.128.  PREPAYMENT OF TAXES BY MANUFACTURED HOUSING RETAILERS.  (a)  In this section:
(1)  "Aggregate tax rate" means the combined tax rates of all appropriate taxing units authorized by law to impose property taxes on a retail manufactured housing inventory.
(2)  "Appropriate taxing unit" means a taxing unit, including the county, authorized by law to impose property taxes on a retail manufactured housing inventory.
(3)  "Chief appraiser," "collector," "declaration," "manufactured housing," "owner," "retail manufactured housing inventory," "retailer," "sales price," "subsequent sale," and "total annual sales" have the meanings assigned by Section 
23.127
.
(4)  "Statement" means the retail manufactured housing inventory tax statement filed on a form adopted by the comptroller under this section.
(5)  "Unit property tax factor" means a number equal to one-twelfth of the preceding year's aggregate ad valorem tax rate at the location at which a retail manufactured housing inventory is located on January 1 of the current year.
(b)  Except for a unit of manufactured housing sold to a retailer or a unit of manufactured housing that is the subject of a subsequent sale, a retailer or a person who has agreed by contract to pay the retailer's current year property taxes imposed on the retailer's manufactured housing inventory shall assign a unit property tax to each unit of manufactured housing sold from a retail manufactured housing inventory.  The unit property tax of each unit of manufactured housing is determined by multiplying the sales price of the unit by the unit property tax factor.  On or before the 10th day of each month the retailer shall, together with the statement filed by the retailer as required by this section, deposit with the collector an amount equal to the total of the unit property tax assigned to all units of manufactured housing sold from the retail manufactured housing inventory in the preceding month to which a unit property tax was assigned.  The collector shall deposit the money to the credit of the retailer's escrow account for prepayment of property taxes as provided by this section.  An escrow account required by this section is used to pay property taxes imposed on the retail manufactured housing inventory, and the retailer shall fund the escrow account as provided by this subsection.
(c)  The collector shall maintain the escrow account for each retailer in the county depository.  The collector is not required to maintain a separate account in the depository for each escrow account created as provided by this section but shall maintain separate records for each retailer.  The collector shall retain any interest generated by the escrow account to defray the cost of administration of the prepayment procedure established by this section.  Interest generated by an escrow account created as provided by this section is the sole property of the collector and may not be used by an entity other than the collector.  Interest generated by an escrow account may not be used to reduce or otherwise affect the annual appropriation to the collector that would otherwise be made.
(d)  The retailer may not withdraw money in an escrow account created under this section.
(e)  The comptroller by rule shall adopt a form entitled "Retail Manufactured Housing Inventory Tax Statement." Each month, a retailer shall complete the form regardless of whether a unit of manufactured housing is sold.  A retailer may not use another form for that purpose.  The statement shall include:
(1)  a description of the unit of manufactured housing sold, including any unique identification or serial number affixed to each unit by the manufacturer;
(2)  the sales price of the unit of manufactured housing;
(3)  any unit property tax of the unit of manufactured housing;
(4)  the reason a unit property tax is not assigned if that is the case; and
(5)  any other information the comptroller considers appropriate.
(f)  On or before the 10th day of each month, a retailer shall file with the collector the statement covering the sale of each unit of manufactured housing sold by the retailer in the preceding month.  On or before the 10th day of a month following a month in which a dealer does not sell a unit of manufactured housing, the dealer must file the statement with the collector and indicate that no sales were made in the prior month.  A retailer shall file a copy of the statement with the chief appraiser and retain documentation relating to the disposition of each unit of manufactured housing sold.  A chief appraiser or collector may examine documents held by a retailer as required by this subsection in the same manner, and subject to the same conditions, as in Section 
23.127
(g).
(g)  Subsection (f) applies to a retailer regardless of whether the retailer owes retail manufactured housing inventory tax for the current year.  A retailer who does not owe any retail manufactured housing inventory tax for the current year because the retailer was not in business on January 1 may not assign a unit property tax to a unit of manufactured housing sold by the retailer or remit money with the statement unless under the terms of a contract as provided by Subsection (k).
(h)  An appropriate taxing unit shall, on its tax bill prepared for the owner of a retail manufactured housing inventory, separately itemize the taxes imposed on the retail manufactured housing inventory.  When the tax bill is prepared for a retail manufactured housing inventory, the assessor for the taxing unit, or an entity, if any, other than the collector, that collects taxes on behalf of the taxing unit, shall provide the collector a true and correct copy of the tax bill sent to the owner, including taxes imposed on the retail manufactured housing inventory.  The collector shall apply the money in the owner's escrow account to the taxes imposed and deliver a tax receipt to the owner.  The collector shall apply the amount to each appropriate taxing unit in proportion to the amount of taxes imposed, and the assessor of each taxing unit shall apply the money received from the collector to the taxes owed by the owner.  No penalties or interest shall be assessed against an owner for property taxes which the owner has previously paid but which are not delivered to the appropriate taxing unit before the date on which such taxes become delinquent.
(i)  If the amount in the escrow account is not sufficient to pay the taxes in full, the collector shall apply the money to the taxes and deliver to the owner a tax receipt for the partial payment and a tax bill for the amount of the deficiency together with a statement that the owner must remit to the collector the balance of the total tax due;  however, no penalty or interest shall be assessed against an owner for that portion of the property taxes which represents the amount of the partial payment if the amount of the deficiency is not paid before the date the deficiency is delinquent.
(j)  The collector shall remit to each appropriate taxing unit the total amount collected by the collector in deficiency payments.  The assessor of each taxing unit shall apply that amount to the taxes owed by the owner.  Taxes that are due but not received by the collector on or before January 31 are delinquent.  Not later than February 15, the collector shall distribute to each appropriate taxing unit in the manner provided by this section all money collected under this section and held in escrow by the collector under this section.  This section does not impose a duty on a collector to collect delinquent taxes that the collector is not otherwise obligated by law or contract to collect.
(k)  A person who acquires the business or assets of a retailer may, by contract, agree to pay the current year retail manufactured housing inventory taxes owed by the retailer.  The retailer who owes the current year tax and the person who acquires the business or assets of the retailer shall jointly notify the chief appraiser and the collector of the terms of the agreement and of the fact that the purchaser has agreed to pay the current year retail manufactured housing inventory taxes owed by the selling retailer.  The chief appraiser and the collector shall adjust their records accordingly.  Notwithstanding Section 
23.127
, a person who agrees to pay current year retail manufactured housing inventory taxes as provided by this subsection is not required to file a declaration until the year following the acquisition.  This subsection does not relieve the selling retailer of tax liability.
(l)  A retailer who fails to file a statement as required by this section commits an offense.  An offense under this subsection is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $100. Each day that a retailer fails to comply with this subsection is a separate violation.
(m)  In addition to other penalties provided by law, a retailer who fails to file or fails to timely file a statement as required by this section is liable for a penalty in the amount of $500 for each month or part of a month in which a statement is not filed after it is due.  A tax lien attaches to the retailer's business personal property to secure payment of the penalty.  The appropriate district attorney, criminal district attorney, county attorney, collector, or person designated by the collector shall collect the penalty established by this section in the name of the collector.  Venue of an action brought under this subsection is in the county in which the violation occurred or in the county in which the retailer maintains the retailer's principal place of business or residence.
(n)  A retailer who fails to remit unit property taxes due as required by this section shall pay a penalty of five percent of the amount due.  If the amount is not paid within 10 days after the due date, the retailer shall pay an additional penalty of five percent of the amount due.  Notwithstanding this section, unit property taxes paid on or before January 31 of the year following the date on which they are due are not delinquent.  The collector, the collector's designated agent, or the county or district attorney shall enforce this subsection.  A penalty under this subsection is in addition to any other penalty provided by law if the owner's taxes are delinquent.
(o)  A fine collected under this section shall be deposited in the county depository to the credit of the general fund.  A penalty collected under this section is the sole property of the collector and may not be used by an entity other than the collector or used to reduce or otherwise affect the annual appropriation to the collector that would otherwise be made.
(p)  Section 
23.123
 applies to a statement filed under this section in the same manner in which that section applies to a statement filed as required by Section 
23.122
.

Sec. 23.175.  OIL OR GAS INTEREST.  (a)  If a real property interest in oil or gas in place is appraised by a method that takes into account the future income from the sale of oil or gas to be produced from the interest, the method must use the average price of the oil or gas from the interest for the preceding calendar year multiplied by a price adjustment factor as the price at which the oil or gas produced from the interest is projected to be sold in the current year of the appraisal.  The average price for the preceding calendar year is calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly average prices for which oil and gas from the interest was selling during each month of the preceding calendar year by 12.  If there was no production of oil or gas from the interest during any month of the preceding calendar year, the average price for which similar oil and gas from comparable interests was selling during that month is to be used.  Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, the chief appraiser shall calculate the price adjustment factor by dividing the spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil in nominal dollars per barrel or the spot price of natural gas at the Henry Hub in nominal dollars per million British thermal units, as applicable, as projected for the current calendar year by the United States Energy Information Administration in the most recently published edition of the Annual Energy Outlook by the spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil in nominal dollars per barrel or the spot price of natural gas at the Henry Hub in nominal dollars per million British thermal units, as applicable, for the preceding calendar year as stated in the same report.  If as of March 1 of the current calendar year the most recently published edition of the Annual Energy Outlook was published before December 1 of the preceding calendar year, the chief appraiser shall use the projected current and preceding calendar year spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil in nominal dollars per barrel or the spot price of natural gas at the Henry Hub in nominal dollars per million British thermal units, as applicable, as stated in the Short-Term Energy Outlook report published in January of the current calendar year by the United States Energy Information Administration in the price adjustment factor calculations.  The price for the interest used in the second through the sixth calendar year of the appraisal may not reflect an annual escalation or de-escalation rate that exceeds the average annual percentage change from 1982 to the most recent year for which the information is available in the producer price index for domestically produced petroleum or for natural gas, as applicable, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.  The price for the interest used in the sixth calendar year of the appraisal must be used in each subsequent year of the appraisal.
(b)  The comptroller by rule shall develop and distribute to each appraisal office appraisal manuals that specify the formula to be used in computing the limit on the price for an interest used in the second through the sixth year of an appraisal and the methods and procedures to discount future income from the sale of oil or gas from the interest to present value.
(c)  Each appraisal office shall use the formula, methods, and procedures specified by the appraisal manuals developed under Subsection (b).

Sec. 23.18.  PROPERTY OWNED BY A NONPROFIT HOMEOWNERS' ORGANIZATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF ITS MEMBERS.  (a)  Because many residential subdivisions are developed on the basis of a nonprofit corporation or association maintaining nominal ownership to property, such as swimming pools, parks, meeting halls, parking lots, tennis courts, or other similar property, that is held for the use, benefit, and enjoyment of the members of the organization, that nominally owned property is to be appraised as provided by this section on the basis of a nominal value to avoid double taxation of the property that would result from taxation on the basis of market value of both the property of the organization and the residential units or lots of the members of the organization, whose property values are enhanced by the right to use the organization's property.
(b)  All property owned by an organization that qualifies as a nonprofit homeowners' organization under this section is appraised at a nominal value as provided by this section if:
(1)  the property is held for the use, benefit, and enjoyment of all members of the organization equally;
(2)  each member of the organization owns an easement, license, or other nonrevokable right for the use and enjoyment on an equal basis of all property held by the organization, even if the right is subject to a restriction imposed by the instruments conveying the right or interest or granting the easement or subject to a rule, regulation, or bylaw imposed by the organization pursuant to authority granted by articles of incorporation, declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions, bylaws, or articles of association of the organization;  and
(3)  each member's easement, license, or other nonrevokable right to the use and enjoyment of the property is appurtenant to and an integral part of the taxable real property owned by the member.
(c)  The chief appraiser, in appraising property owned by a member of a qualified nonprofit homeowners' organization who is entitled to the use and enjoyment of facilities owned by the organization, shall consider the enhanced value of the property resulting from the member's right to the use and benefit of those facilities.
(d)  An organization qualifies as a nonprofit homeowners' organization under this section if:
(1)  it engages in residential real estate management;
(2)  it is organized and operated to provide for the acquisition, construction, management, maintenance, and care of property nominally owned by the organization and held for the use, benefit, and enjoyment of its members;
(3)  60 percent or more of the gross income of the organization consists of amounts received as membership dues, fees, or assessments from owners of residences or residential lots within an area subject to the jurisdiction and assessment of the organization;

Sec. 23.19.  PROPERTY OCCUPIED BY STOCKHOLDERS OF CORPORATION INCORPORATED UNDER COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION ACT.  (a)  In this section, "cooperative housing corporation" means a corporation incorporated under the Cooperative Association Act (Article 1396-50.01, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes) to provide dwelling places for its stockholders.
(b)  If an appraisal district receives a written request for the appraisal of real property and improvements of a cooperative housing corporation according to the separate interests of the corporation's stockholders, the chief appraiser shall separately appraise the interests described by Subsection (d) if the conditions required by Subsections (e) and (f) have been met.  Separate appraisal under this section is for the purposes of administration of tax exemptions, determination of applicable limitations of taxes under Section 
11.26
 or 
11.261
, and apportionment by a cooperative housing corporation of property taxes among its stockholders but is not the basis for determining value on which a tax is imposed under this title.  A stockholder whose interest is separately appraised under this section may protest and appeal the appraised value in the manner provided by this title for protest and appeal of the appraised value of other property.
(c)  An appraisal under this section applies to the tax year in which a request is made under this section only if the request is received by the appraisal district before March 1.  After the first separate appraisal of interests of stockholders of a cooperative housing corporation under this section, separate appraisals of interests of stockholders of the corporation shall be made in subsequent years without further request.  A request may not be rescinded after the first separate appraisal has been made, and a request is binding on future owners and stockholders of the corporation.
(d)  The interest that is to be separately appraised under this section is the market value of the right of exclusive occupancy of each separate dwelling place that is transferable only concurrently with the transfer of stock ownership in the corporation by the person having the right of occupancy, together with the market value of the right of use of a portion of the total common area used in the residential occupancy that is equal to the percentage of the total amount of the stock issued by the corporation that is owned by the stockholder.
(e)  A separate appraisal of interests under this section may not be made unless:
(1)  the person making the request files a resolution of the board of directors of the corporation certifying that the stockholders of the corporation have approved the request in the manner provided by the corporate articles of incorporation or bylaws for approval of matters affecting the corporation generally;  and
(2)  a diagrammatic floor plan of the improvements and a survey plot map of the land showing the location of the improvements on the land have been filed with the appraisal district.
(f)  The chief appraiser may require a cooperative housing corporation for which separate appraisal of interests has been requested under this section to submit or verify a list of stockholders of the corporation at least annually.
(g)  A tax bill or a separate statement accompanying the tax bill to a cooperative housing corporation for which interests of stockholders are separately appraised under this section must state, in addition to the information required by Section 
31.01
, the appraised value and taxable value of each interest separately appraised.  Each exemption claimed as provided by this title by a person entitled to the exemption shall also be deducted from the total appraised value of the property of the corporation.  The total tax imposed by a school district, county, municipality, or junior college district shall be reduced by any amount that represents an increase in taxes attributable to separately appraised interests of the real property and improvements that are subject to the limitation of taxes prescribed by Section 
11.26
 or 
11.261
.  The corporation shall apportion among its stockholders liability for reimbursing the corporation for property taxes according to the relative taxable values of their interests.
(h)  A cooperative housing corporation remains liable for payment of all taxes, penalties, and interest imposed under this title on property owned by the corporation, and the tax lien attaches to the entirety of the property.
(i)  The chief appraiser may charge a fee in an amount not to exceed $100 for the initial cost of separately appraising interests in a cooperative housing corporation.

Sec. 23.20.  WAIVER OF SPECIAL APPRAISAL.  (a)  An owner of inventory or real property may in writing waive the right to special appraisal provided by Section 
23.12
 or Subchapter C, D, E, F, or G as to one or more taxing units designated in the waiver.  In a tax year in which a waiver is in effect, the property is appraised for each taxing unit to which the waiver applies at the value determined under Subchapter A of this chapter or the value determined under Section 
23.12
 or Subchapter C, D, E, F, or G, whichever is the greater value.
(b)  A waiver of the right to special appraisal provided by Section 
23.12
 may be submitted at any time.  A waiver of the right to special appraisal provided by Subchapter C, D, E, F, or G may be submitted with an application for appraisal under that subchapter or at any other time.  A property owner who has waived special appraisal under this section as to one or more taxing units may make additional waivers under this section as to other taxing units in which the property is located.
(c)  A waiver under this section is effective for 25 consecutive tax years beginning on the first tax year in which the waiver is effective without regard to whether the property is subject to appraisal under Section 
23.12
 or Subchapter C, D, E, F, or G. To be effective in the year in which the waiver is executed, it must be filed before May 1 of that year with the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the property is located, unless for good cause shown the chief appraiser extends the filing deadline for not more than 60 days.  An application filed after the year's deadline takes effect in the next tax year.
(d)  A waiver filed under this section is applicable to the property for the term of the waiver, runs with any land to which the waiver applies, and is binding on the owner who executed the waiver and any successor in interest.  A waiver may not be revoked as to any taxing unit except on approval by official action of the governing body of the taxing unit on a finding by the governing body that the revocation of the waiver would not materially impair the contractual, bond, or other debt obligation of the taxing unit wholly or partly payable from property taxes to which the property is subject.  An application for revocation must be filed with the governing body of each taxing unit to which the revocation is to apply.  A waiver may not be revoked if revocation is prohibited under a rule adopted under Subsection (e). The revocation is effective in the year in which the governing body approves the revocation if the chief appraiser receives a written notice of the approval before the appraisal review board approves the appraisal records.  If the notice is not received before the deadline the revocation takes effect in the next tax year.
(e)  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, a commissioners court, and the Texas Transportation Commission each, by rule, may ensure that a waiver under this section that applies to real property is properly and timely executed, and is irrevocable by the owner of the property to which the waiver applies or by any other related person receiving or proposing to receive, directly or indirectly, the proceeds of any bonds issued by or to be issued by the taxing unit.  The rules of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality apply to waivers applicable to taxing units that are conservation and reclamation districts subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.  The rules of the commissioners court apply to waivers applicable to taxing units that are road districts created by the commissioners court.  The rules of the Texas Transportation Commission apply to waivers applicable to taxing units that are road utility districts subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
(f)  For computations required to be made under this title, the appraised value of the property for taxation by a taxing unit to which a waiver applies is the value at which the property is taxed under this section.
(g)  A waiver of a special appraisal of property under Subchapter C, D, E, F, or G of this chapter does not constitute a change of use of the property or diversion of the property to another use for purposes of the imposition of additional taxes under any of those subchapters.

Sec. 23.21.  PROPERTY USED TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.  (a)  In appraising real property that is rented or leased to a low-income individual or family meeting income-eligibility standards established by the owner of the property under regulations or restrictions limiting to a percentage of the individual's or the family's income the amount that the individual or family may be required to pay for the rental or lease of the property, the chief appraiser shall take into account the extent to which that use and limitation reduce the market value of the property.
(b)  In appraising real property that is rented or leased to a low-income individual or family meeting income-eligibility standards established by a governmental entity or under a governmental contract for affordable housing limiting the amount that the individual or family may be required to pay for the rental or lease of the property, the chief appraiser shall take into account the extent to which that use and limitation reduce the market value of the property.
(c)  In appraising land that is leased by a community land trust created or designated under Section 
373B.002
, Local Government Code, to a family meeting the income-eligibility standards established by Section 373B.006 of that code under regulations or restrictions limiting the amount that the family may be required to pay for the rental or lease of the property, the chief appraiser shall use the income method of appraisal as described by Section 
23.012
 to determine the appraised value of the property.  The chief appraiser shall use that method regardless of whether the chief appraiser considers that method to be the most appropriate method of appraising the property.  In appraising the property, the chief appraiser shall:
(1)  take into account the uses and limitations applicable to the property, including the terms of the lease applicable to the property, for purposes of computing the actual rental income from the property and projecting future rental income; and
(2)  use the same capitalization rate that the chief appraiser uses to appraise other rent-restricted properties.
(c-1)  In appraising a housing unit that is leased by a community land trust created or designated under Section 
373B.002
, Local Government Code, to a family meeting the income-eligibility standards established by Section 373B.006 of that code under regulations or restrictions limiting the amount that the family may be required to pay for the rental or lease of the property, the chief appraiser shall use the income method of appraisal as described by Section 
23.012
 to determine the appraised value of the property.  The chief appraiser shall use that method regardless of whether the chief appraiser considers that method to be the most appropriate method of appraising the property.  In appraising the property, the chief appraiser shall:
(1)  take into account the uses and limitations applicable to the property, including the terms of the lease applicable to the property, for purposes of computing the actual rental income from the property and projecting future rental income; and
(2)  use the same capitalization rate that the chief appraiser uses to appraise other rent-restricted properties.
(d)  In appraising a housing unit that the owner or a predecessor of the owner acquired from a community land trust created or designated under Section 
373B.002
, Local Government Code, and that is located on land owned by the trust and leased by the owner of the housing unit, the chief appraiser shall take into account the extent to which any regulations or restrictions limiting the right of the owner of the housing unit to sell the housing unit, including any limitation on the price for which the housing unit may be sold, reduce the market value of the housing unit.  If the sale of the housing unit is subject to an eligible land use restriction, the chief appraiser may not appraise the housing unit in a tax year for an amount that exceeds the price for which the housing unit may be sold under the eligible land use restriction in that tax year.  For purposes of this subsection, "eligible land use restriction" means an agreement, deed restriction, or restrictive covenant applicable to the housing unit that:

(2)  has a term of at least 40 years;
(3)  restricts the price for which the housing unit may be sold to a price that is equal to or less than the market value of the housing unit; and
(4)  restricts the sale of the housing unit to a family meeting the income-eligibility standards established by Section

, Local Government Code.
(e)  In appraising real property that was previously owned by an organization that received an exemption for the property under Section 
11.181
(a) and that was sold to a low-income individual or family meeting income eligibility standards established by the organization under regulations or restrictions limiting to a percentage of the individual's or the family's income the amount that the individual or family was required to pay for purchasing the property, the chief appraiser shall take into account the extent to which that use and limitation and any resale restrictions or conditions applicable to the property established by the organization reduce the market value of the property.

SUBCHAPTER C. LAND DESIGNATED FOR AGRICULTURAL USE
Sec. 23.41.  APPRAISAL.  (a)  Land designated for agricultural use is appraised at its value based on the land's capacity to produce agricultural products.  The value of land based on its capacity to produce agricultural products is determined by capitalizing the average net income the land would have yielded under prudent management from production of agricultural products during the five years preceding the current year.  However, if the value of land as determined by capitalization of average net income exceeds the market value of the land as determined by other generally accepted appraisal methods, the land shall be appraised by application of the other appraisal methods.
(b)  The comptroller shall promulgate rules specifying the methods to apply and the procedures to use in appraising land designated for agricultural use.
(c), (d) Repealed by Acts 1999, 76th Leg., ch. 574, Sec. 2(2), eff. June 18, 1999.
(e)  Improvements other than appurtenances to the land, the mineral estate, and all land used for residential purposes and for processing harvested agricultural products are appraised separately at market value.  Riparian water rights, private roads, dams, reservoirs, water wells, and canals, ditches, terraces, and similar reshapings of or additions to the soil for agricultural purposes are appurtenances to the land, and the effect of each on the value of the land for agricultural use shall be considered in appraising the land.  However, the comptroller shall provide that in calculating average net income from land a deduction from income be allowed for an appurtenance subject to depreciation or depletion.

Sec. 23.42.  ELIGIBILITY.  (a)  An individual is entitled to have land he owns designated for agricultural use if, on January 1:
(1)  the land has been devoted exclusively to or developed continuously for agriculture for the three years preceding the current year;
(2)  the individual is using and intends to use the land for agriculture as an occupation or a business venture for profit during the current year; and
(3)  agriculture is the individual's primary occupation and primary source of income.

(b)  Use of land for nonagricultural purposes does not deprive an owner of his right to an agricultural designation if the nonagricultural use is secondary to and compatible with the agricultural use of the land.
(c)  Agriculture is an individual's primary occupation and primary source of income if as of January 1 he devotes a greater portion of his time to and derives a greater portion of his gross income from agriculture than any other occupation.  The time an individual devotes to each occupation and the gross income he derives from each is determined by averaging the time he devoted to each and the gross income he derived from each for any number of consecutive years not exceeding five years immediately preceding January 1 of the current year, that he has engaged in agriculture as an occupation.  However, if he has not been engaged in agriculture as an occupation for the entire year preceding January 1, the time he has devoted to and the income he has derived from each occupation since the date he began engaging in agriculture as an occupation determine whether agriculture is his primary occupation and primary source of income.
(d)  For purposes of this section:
(1)  "Agriculture" means the use of land to produce plant or animal products, including fish or poultry products, under natural conditions but does not include the processing of plant or animal products after harvesting or the production of timber or forest products.
(2)  "Occupation" includes employment and a business venture that requires continual supervision or management.

Sec. 23.426.  TEMPORARY CESSATION OF AGRICULTURAL USE DUE TO QUARANTINE FOR TICKS.  (a)  The entitlement of an individual to have land the individual owns designated for agricultural use under this subchapter does not end because the individual ceases exclusively or continuously using the land for agriculture as an occupation or a business venture for profit for the period prescribed by Subsection (b) if the land:
(1)  is subject to a temporary quarantine established at any time during the tax year by the Texas Animal Health Commission for the purpose of regulating the handling of livestock and eradicating ticks or exposure to ticks under Chapter 
167
, Agriculture Code; and
(2)  otherwise continues to qualify for the designation under Section 
23.42

(d)  The comptroller in prescribing the contents of the application forms shall ensure that each form requires a claimant to furnish the information necessary to determine the validity of the claim.  The comptroller shall require that the form permit a claimant who has previously been allowed an agricultural designation to indicate that previously reported information has not changed and to supply only the eligibility information not previously reported.  The form must include a space for the claimant to state the claimant's date of birth.  Failure to provide the date of birth does not affect a claimant's right to an agricultural designation under this subchapter.

Sec. 23.46.  ADDITIONAL TAXATION.  (a)  When appraising land designated for agricultural use, the chief appraiser also shall appraise the land at its market value and shall record both the market value and the value based on its capacity to produce agricultural products in the appraisal records.
(b)  Property taxes imposed on land designated for agricultural use are based on the land's agricultural use value determined as provided by Section 
23.41
 of this code after the appropriate assessment ratio has been applied to that value.  When an assessor calculates the amount of tax due on the land, however, he shall also calculate the amount of tax that would have been imposed had the land not been designated for agricultural use.  The difference in the amount of tax imposed and the amount that would have been imposed is the amount of additional tax for that year, and the assessor shall enter that amount in his tax records relating to the property.
(c)  If land that has been designated for agricultural use in any year is sold or diverted to a nonagricultural use, the total amount of additional taxes for the three years preceding the year in which the land is sold or diverted plus interest at the rate provided for delinquent taxes becomes due.  Subject to Subsection (f), a determination that the land has been diverted to a nonagricultural use is made by the chief appraiser.  For purposes of this subsection, the chief appraiser may not consider any period during which land is owned by the state in determining whether the land has been diverted to a nonagricultural use.  The chief appraiser shall deliver a notice of the determination to the owner of the land as soon as possible after making the determination and shall include in the notice an explanation of the owner's right to protest the determination.  If the owner does not file a timely protest or if the final determination of the protest is that the additional taxes are due, the assessor for each taxing unit shall prepare and deliver a bill for the additional taxes plus interest as soon as practicable after the change of use occurs.  If the additional taxes are due because of a sale of the land, the assessor for each taxing unit shall prepare and deliver the bill as soon as practicable after the sale occurs.  The taxes and interest are due and become delinquent and incur penalties and interest as provided by law for ad valorem taxes imposed by the taxing unit if not paid before the next February 1 that is at least 20 days after the date the bill is delivered to the owner of the land.
(d)  A tax lien attaches to the land on the date the sale or change of use occurs to secure payment of the additional tax and interest imposed by Subsection (c) of this section and any penalties incurred.  The lien exists in favor of all taxing units for which the additional tax is imposed.
(e)  Land is not diverted to nonagricultural use for purposes of Subsection (c) of this section solely because the owner of the land claims it as part of his residence homestead for purposes of Section 
11.13
 of this code.
(e-1)  A portion of a parcel of land is not diverted to nonagricultural use for purposes of Subsection (c) because the portion is subject to a right-of-way that is less than 200 feet wide and that was taken by condemnation if the remainder of the parcel of land qualifies for appraisal under this subchapter.
(f)  If land designated for agricultural use under this subchapter is owned by an individual 65 years of age or older, before making a determination that the land has been diverted to a nonagricultural use, the chief appraiser shall deliver a written notice to the owner stating that the chief appraiser believes the land may have been diverted to a nonagricultural use.  The notice must include a form on which the owner may indicate that the owner remains entitled to have the land designated for agricultural use and a self-addressed postage prepaid envelope with instructions for returning the form to the chief appraiser.  The chief appraiser shall consider the owner's response on the form in determining whether the land has been diverted to a nonagricultural use.  If the chief appraiser does not receive a response on or before the 60th day after the date the notice is mailed, the chief appraiser must make a reasonable effort to locate the owner and determine whether the owner remains entitled to have the land designated for agricultural use before determining that the land has been diverted to a nonagricultural use.  For purposes of this subsection, sending an additional notice to the owner immediately after the expiration of the 60-day period by first class mail in an envelope on which is written, in all capital letters, "RETURN SERVICE REQUESTED," or another appropriate statement directing the United States Postal Service to return the notice if it is not deliverable as addressed, or providing the additional notice in another manner that the chief appraiser determines is appropriate, constitutes a reasonable effort on the part of the chief appraiser.
(g)  If the additional taxes are due because the land has been diverted to a nonagricultural use as a result of a condemnation, the additional taxes and interest imposed by this section are the personal obligation of the condemning entity and not the property owner from whom the property was taken.

Sec. 23.47.  LOAN SECURED BY LIEN ON AGRICULTURAL-USE LAND.  (a)  A lender may not require as a condition to granting or amending the terms of a loan secured by a lien in favor of the lender on land appraised according to this subchapter that the borrower waive the right to the appraisal or agree not to apply for or receive the appraisal.
(b)  A provision in an instrument pertaining to a loan secured by a lien in favor of the lender on land appraised according to this subchapter is void to the extent that the provision attempts to require the borrower to waive the right to the appraisal or to prohibit the borrower from applying for or receiving the appraisal.
(c)  A provision in an instrument pertaining to a loan secured by a lien in favor of the lender on land appraised according to this subchapter that requires the borrower to make a payment to protect the lender from loss because of the imposition of additional taxes and interest under Section 
23.46
 is void unless the provision:
(1)  requires the borrower to pay into an escrow account established by the lender an amount equal to the additional taxes and interest that would be due under Section 
23.46
 if a sale or change of use occurred on January 1 of the year in which the loan is granted or amended;
(2)  requires the escrow account to bear interest to be credited to the account monthly;
(3)  permits the lender to apply money in the escrow account to the payment of a bill for additional taxes and interest under Section 
23.46
 before the loan is paid and requires the lender to refund the balance remaining in the escrow account after the bill is paid to the borrower;  and
(4)  requires the lender to refund the money in the escrow account to the borrower on the payment of the loan.
(d)  On the request of the borrower or the borrower's representative, the assessor for each taxing unit shall compute the additional taxes and interest that would be due that taxing unit under Section 
23.46
 if a sale or change of use occurred on January 1 of the year in which the loan is granted or amended.  The assessor may charge a reasonable fee not to exceed the actual cost of making the computation.
(e)  In this section, "lender" means a lending institution, including a bank, trust company, banking association, savings and loan association, mortgage company, investment bank, credit union, life insurance company, or governmental agency that customarily provides financing or an affiliate of any of those entities.  The term does not include an agency of the United States.

Sec. 23.48.  REAPPRAISAL OF LAND SUBJECT TO TEMPORARY QUARANTINE FOR TICKS.  (a)  An owner of land designated for agricultural use on which the Texas Animal Health Commission has established a temporary quarantine of at least 90 days in length in the current tax year for the purpose of regulating the handling of livestock and eradicating ticks or exposure to ticks at any time during a tax year is entitled to a reappraisal of the owner's land for that year on written request delivered to the chief appraiser.
(b)  As soon as practicable after receiving a request for reappraisal, the chief appraiser shall complete the reappraisal.  In determining the appraised value of the land under Section 
23.41
, the effect on the value of the land caused by the infestation of ticks is an additional factor that must be taken into account.  The appraised value of land reappraised under this section may not exceed the lesser of:
(1)  the market value of the land as determined by other appraisal methods; or
(2)  one-half of the original appraised value of the land for the current tax year.
(c)  A property owner may not be required to pay the appraisal district for the costs of making the reappraisal.  Each taxing unit that participates in the appraisal district and imposes taxes on the land shall share the costs of the reappraisal in the proportion the total dollar amount of taxes imposed by that taxing unit on that land in the preceding year bears to the total dollar amount of taxes all taxing units participating in the appraisal district imposed on the land in the preceding year.
(d)  If land is reappraised as provided by this section, the governing body of each taxing unit that participates in the appraisal district and imposes  taxes on the land shall provide for prorating the taxes on the land for the tax year in which the reappraisal is conducted.  If the taxes are prorated, taxes due on the land are determined as follows:  the taxes on the land based on its value on January 1 of that year are multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days in that year before the date the reappraisal was conducted; the taxes on the land based on its reappraised value are multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days, including the date the reappraisal was conducted, remaining in the year; and the total of the two amounts is the amount of taxes imposed on the land for that year.  Notwithstanding Section 
26.15
, the assessor for each applicable taxing unit shall enter the reappraised value on the appropriate tax roll together with the original appraised value and the calculation of the taxes imposed on the land under this section.  If for any tax year the reappraisal results in a decrease in the tax liability of the landowner, the assessor for the taxing unit shall prepare and mail a new tax bill in the manner provided by Chapter 
31
.  If the owner has paid the tax, each taxing unit that imposed taxes on the land in that year shall promptly refund the difference between the tax paid and the tax due on the lower appraised value.
(e)  In appraising the land for any subsequent tax year in which the Texas Animal Health Commission quarantine remains in place, the chief appraiser shall continue to take into account the effect on the value of the land caused by the infestation of ticks.
(f)  If the owner of the land is informed by the Texas Animal Health Commission that the quarantine is no longer in place, not later than the 30th day after the date on which the owner received that information the owner of the land shall so notify the chief appraiser in writing.  If the owner fails to notify the chief appraiser as required by this subsection, a penalty is imposed on the property equal to 10 percent of the difference between the taxes imposed on the property in each year it is erroneously allowed appraisal under this section and the taxes that would otherwise have been imposed.
(g)  The chief appraiser shall make an entry in the appraisal records for the property against which the penalty is imposed indicating liability for the penalty and shall deliver a written notice of imposition of the penalty to the person who owns the property.  The notice shall include a brief explanation of the procedures for protesting the imposition of the penalty.  The assessor for each taxing unit that imposed taxes on the property on the basis of appraisal under this section shall add the amount of the penalty to the unit's tax bill for taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The penalty shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The amount of the penalty constitutes a lien on the property against which the penalty is imposed and accrues penalty and interest in the same manner as a delinquent tax.

(1)  "Qualified open-space land" means land that is currently devoted principally to agricultural use to the degree of intensity generally accepted in the area and that has been devoted principally to agricultural use or to production of timber or forest products for five of the preceding seven years or land that is used principally as an ecological laboratory by a public or private college or university and that has been used principally in that manner by a college or university for five of the preceding seven years.  Qualified open-space land includes all appurtenances to the land.  For the purposes of this subdivision, appurtenances to the land means private roads, dams, reservoirs, water wells, canals, ditches, terraces, and other reshapings of the soil, fences, and riparian water rights.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subdivision, land that is currently devoted principally to wildlife management as defined by Subdivision (7)(B) or (C) to the degree of intensity generally accepted in the area qualifies for appraisal as qualified open-space land under this subchapter regardless of the manner in which the land was used in any preceding year.
(2)  "Agricultural use" includes but is not limited to the following activities:  cultivating the soil, producing crops for human food, animal feed, or planting seed or for the production of fibers; floriculture, viticulture, and horticulture; raising or keeping livestock; raising or keeping exotic animals for the production of human food or of fiber, leather, pelts, or other tangible products having a commercial value; planting cover crops or leaving land idle for the purpose of participating in a governmental program, provided the land is not used for residential purposes or a purpose inconsistent with agricultural use; and planting cover crops or leaving land idle in conjunction with normal crop or livestock rotation procedure.  The term also includes the use of land to produce or harvest logs and posts for the use in constructing or repairing fences, pens, barns, or other agricultural improvements on adjacent qualified open-space land having the same owner and devoted to a different agricultural use.  The term also includes the use of land for wildlife management.  The term also includes the use of land to raise or keep bees for pollination or for the production of human food or other tangible products having a commercial value, provided that the land used is not less than 5 or more than 20 acres.
(3)  "Category" means the value classification of land considering the agricultural use to which the land is principally devoted.  The chief appraiser shall determine the categories into which land in the appraisal district is classified.  In classifying land according to categories, the chief appraiser shall distinguish between irrigated cropland, dry cropland, improved pasture, native pasture, orchard, and waste.  The chief appraiser may establish additional categories.  The chief appraiser shall further divide each category according to soil type, soil capability, irrigation, general topography, geographical factors, and other factors that influence the productive capacity of the category.  The chief appraiser shall obtain information from the Texas Agricultural Extension Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, and other recognized agricultural sources for the purposes of determining the categories of land existing in the appraisal district.
(4)  "Net to land" means the average annual net income derived from the use of open-space land that would have been earned from the land during the five-year period preceding the year before the appraisal by an owner using ordinary prudence in the management of the land and the farm crops or livestock produced or supported on the land and, in addition, any income received from hunting or recreational leases.  The chief appraiser shall calculate net to land by considering the income that would be due to the owner of the land under cash lease, share lease, or whatever lease arrangement is typical in that area for that category of land, and all expenses directly attributable to the agricultural use of the land by the owner shall be subtracted from this owner income and the results shall be used in income capitalization.  In calculating net to land, a reasonable deduction shall be made for any depletion that occurs of underground water used in the agricultural operation.  In this subdivision, "wildlife or livestock disease or pest area" means an area designated by a state agency as an area in which a disease or pest that affects wildlife or livestock exists or may exist, including a chronic wasting disease containment or surveillance zone and an area subject to a quarantine authorized by Subtitle C, Title 6, Agriculture Code. In calculating net to land of open-space land located in or adjacent to a wildlife or livestock disease or pest area, the chief appraiser shall take into consideration the effect that the presence of the applicable disease or pest or the designation of the area has on the net income from the land.  For land that qualifies under Subdivision (7) for appraisal under this subchapter, the chief appraiser may not consider in the calculation of net to land the income that would be due to the owner under a hunting or recreational lease of the land.
(5)  "Income capitalization" means the process of dividing net to land by the capitalization rate to determine the appraised value.
(6)  "Exotic animal" means a species of game not indigenous to this state, including axis deer, nilga antelope, red sheep, other cloven-hoofed ruminant mammals, or exotic fowl as defined by Section 
142.001
, Agriculture Code.
(7)  "Wildlife management" means:
(A)  actively using land that at the time the wildlife-management use began was appraised as qualified open-space land under this subchapter or as qualified timber land under Subchapter E in at least three of the following ways to propagate a sustaining breeding, migrating, or wintering population of indigenous wild animals for human use, including food, medicine, or recreation:
(i)  habitat control;
(ii)  erosion control;
(iii)  predator control;
(iv)  providing supplemental supplies of water;
(v)  providing supplemental supplies of food;
(vi)  providing shelters; and
(vii)  making of census counts to determine population;
(B)  actively using land to protect federally listed endangered species under a federal permit if the land is:
(i)  included in a habitat preserve and is subject to a conservation easement created under Chapter 
183
, Natural Resources Code; or
(ii)  part of a conservation development under a federally approved habitat conservation plan that restricts the use of the land to protect federally listed endangered species; or
(C)  actively using land for a conservation or restoration project to provide compensation for natural resource damages pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq.), the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. Section 2701 et seq.), the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. Section 1251 et seq.), or Chapter 
40
, Natural Resources Code.
(8)  "Endangered species," "federal permit," and "habitat preserve" have the meanings assigned by Section 
83.011
, Parks and Wildlife Code.

Sec. 23.54.  APPLICATION.  (a)  A person claiming that his land is eligible for appraisal under this subchapter must file a valid application with the chief appraiser.
(b)  To be valid, the application must:
(1)  be on a form provided by the appraisal office and prescribed by the comptroller;  and
(2)  contain the information necessary to determine the validity of the claim.
(c)  The comptroller shall include on the form a notice of the penalties prescribed by Section 
37.10
, Penal Code, for making or filing an application containing a false statement.  The comptroller, in prescribing the contents of the application form, shall require that the form permit a claimant who has previously been allowed appraisal under this subchapter to indicate that previously reported information has not changed and to supply only the eligibility information not previously reported.  The form must include a space for the claimant to state the claimant's date of birth.  Failure to provide the date of birth does not affect a claimant's eligibility to have the claimant's land appraised under this subchapter.
(d)  The form must be filed before May 1.  However, for good cause the chief appraiser may extend the filing deadline for not more than 60 days.
(e)  If a person fails to file a valid application on time, the land is ineligible for appraisal as provided by this subchapter for that year.  Once an application is filed and appraisal under this subchapter is allowed, the land is eligible for appraisal under this subchapter in subsequent years without a new application unless the ownership of the land changes or its eligibility under this subchapter ends.  However, subject to Section 
23.551
, if the chief appraiser has good cause to believe that land is no longer eligible for appraisal under this subchapter, the chief appraiser may require a person allowed appraisal under this subchapter in a prior year to file a new application to confirm that the land is currently eligible for appraisal under this subchapter by delivering a written notice that a new application is required, accompanied by the application form, to the person who filed the application that was previously allowed.
(e-1)  For purposes of Subsection (e), ownership of the land is not considered to have changed if ownership of the land is transferred from the former owner to the surviving spouse of the former owner.
(f)  The appraisal office shall make a sufficient number of printed application forms readily available at no charge.
(g)  Each year the chief appraiser for each appraisal district shall publicize, in a manner reasonably designed to notify all residents of the district, the requirements of this section and the availability of application forms.
(h)  A person whose land is allowed appraisal under this subchapter shall notify the appraisal office in writing before May 1 after eligibility of the land under this subchapter ends or after a change in the category of agricultural use.  If a person fails to notify the appraisal office as required by this subsection a penalty is imposed on the property equal to 10 percent of the difference between the taxes imposed on the property in each year it is erroneously allowed appraisal under this subchapter and the taxes that would otherwise have been imposed.
(i)  The chief appraiser shall make an entry in the appraisal records for the property against which the penalty is imposed indicating liability for the penalty and shall deliver a written notice of imposition of the penalty to the person who owns the property.  The notice shall include a brief explanation of the procedures for protesting the imposition of the penalty.  The assessor for each taxing unit that imposed taxes on the property on the basis of appraisal under this subchapter shall add the amount of the penalty to the unit's tax bill for taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The penalty shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The amount of the penalty constitutes a lien on the property against which the penalty is imposed and accrues penalty and interest in the same manner as a delinquent tax.
(j)  If the chief appraiser discovers that appraisal under this subchapter has been erroneously allowed in any one of the five preceding years because of failure of the person whose land was allowed appraisal under this subchapter to give notice that its eligibility has ended, he shall add the difference between the appraised value of the land under this subchapter and the market value of the land to the appraisal roll as provided by Section 
25.21
 of this code for other property that escapes taxation.

Sec. 23.541.  LATE APPLICATION FOR APPRAISAL AS AGRICULTURAL LAND.  (a)  The chief appraiser shall accept and approve or deny an application for appraisal under this subchapter after the deadline for filing it has passed if it is filed before approval of the appraisal records by the appraisal review board.
(a-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the chief appraiser shall accept and approve or deny an application for appraisal under this subchapter after the deadline for filing the application has passed if:
(1)  the land that is the subject of the application was appraised under this subchapter in the preceding tax year;
(2)  the ownership of the land changed as a result of the death of an owner of the land during the preceding tax year; and
(3)  the application is filed not later than the delinquency date for the taxes on the land for the year for which the application is filed by:
(A)  the surviving spouse or a surviving child of the decedent;
(B)  the executor or administrator of the estate of the decedent; or
(C)  a fiduciary acting on behalf of the surviving spouse or a surviving child of the decedent.
(b)  If appraisal under this subchapter is approved when the application is filed late, the owner is liable for a penalty of 10 percent of the difference between the amount of tax imposed on the property and the amount that would be imposed if the property were taxed at market value.  The penalty prescribed by this subsection does not apply to a late application filed under Subsection (a-1).
(c)  The chief appraiser shall make an entry on the appraisal records indicating the person's liability for the penalty and shall deliver written notice of imposition of the penalty, explaining the reason for its imposition, to the person.
(d)  The tax assessor for a taxing unit that taxes land based on an appraisal under this subchapter after a late application shall add the amount of the penalty to the owner's tax bill, and the tax collector for the unit shall collect the penalty at the time and in the manner he collects the tax.  The amount of the penalty constitutes a lien against the property against which the penalty is imposed, as if it were a tax, and accrues penalty and interest in the same manner as a delinquent tax.

Sec. 23.55.  CHANGE OF USE OF LAND.  (a)  If the use of land that has been appraised as provided by this subchapter changes, an additional tax is imposed on the land equal to the difference between the taxes imposed on the land for each of the three years preceding the year in which the change of use occurs that the land was appraised as provided by this subchapter and the tax that would have been imposed had the land been taxed on the basis of market value in each of those years. For purposes of this subsection, the chief appraiser may not consider any period during which land is owned by the state in determining whether a change in the use of the land has occurred.
(b)  A tax lien attaches to the land on the date the change of use occurs to secure payment of the additional tax imposed by this section and any penalties and interest incurred if the tax becomes delinquent.  The lien exists in favor of all taxing units for which the additional tax is imposed.
(c)  The additional tax imposed by this section does not apply to a year for which the tax has already been imposed.
(d)  If the change of use applies to only part of a parcel that has been appraised as provided by this subchapter, the additional tax applies only to that part of the parcel and equals the difference between the taxes imposed on that part of the parcel and the taxes that would have been imposed had that part been taxed on the basis of market value.
(e)  Subject to Section 
23.551
, a determination that a change in use of the land has occurred is made by the chief appraiser.  The chief appraiser shall deliver a notice of the determination to the owner of the land as soon as possible after making the determination and shall include in the notice an explanation of the owner's right to protest the determination.  If the owner does not file a timely protest or if the final determination of the protest is that the additional taxes are due, the assessor for each taxing unit shall prepare and deliver a bill for the additional taxes as soon as practicable.  The taxes are due and become delinquent and incur penalties and interest as provided by law for ad valorem taxes imposed by the taxing unit if not paid before the next February 1 that is at least 20 days after the date the bill is delivered to the owner of the land.
(f)  The sanctions provided by Subsection (a) do not apply if the change of use occurs as a result of:
(1)  a sale for right-of-way;
(2)  a condemnation;
(3)  a transfer of the property to the state or a political subdivision of the state to be used for a public purpose; or
(4)  a transfer of the property from the state, a political subdivision of the state, or a nonprofit corporation created by a municipality with a population of more than one million under the Development Corporation Act (Subtitle C1, Title 12, Local Government Code) to an individual or a business entity for purposes of economic development if the comptroller determines that the economic development is likely to generate for deposit in the general revenue fund during the next two fiscal bienniums an amount of taxes and other revenues that equals or exceeds 20 times the amount of additional taxes that would have been imposed under Subsection (a) had the sanctions provided by that subsection applied to the transfer.
(g)  If the use of the land changes to a use that qualifies under Subchapter E of this chapter, the sanctions provided by Subsection (a) of this section do not apply.
(h)  Additional taxes, if any, for a year in which land was designated for agricultural use as provided by Subchapter C of this chapter  (or Article VIII, Section 1-d, of the constitution) are determined as provided by that subchapter, and the additional taxes imposed by this section do not apply for that year.
(i)  The use of land does not change for purposes of Subsection (a) of this section solely because the owner of the land claims it as part of his residence homestead for purposes of Section 
11.13
 of this code.
(j)  The sanctions provided by Subsection (a) do not apply to a change in the use of land if:
(1)  the land is located in an unincorporated area of a county with a population of less than 100,000;
(2)  the land does not exceed five acres;
(3)  the land is owned by a not-for-profit cemetery organization;
(4)  the cemetery organization dedicates the land for a cemetery purpose;
(5)  the cemetery organization has not dedicated more than five acres of land in the county for a cemetery purpose in the five years preceding the date the cemetery organization dedicates the land for a cemetery purpose;  and
(6)  the land is adjacent to a cemetery that has been in existence for more than 100 years.
(k)  In Subsection (j), "cemetery," "cemetery organization," and "cemetery purpose" have the meanings assigned those terms by Section 
711.001
, Health and Safety Code.
(l)  The sanctions provided by Subsection (a) of this section do not apply to land owned by an organization that qualifies as a religious organization under Section 
11.20
(c) of this code if the organization converts the land to a use for which the land is eligible for an exemption under Section 
11.20
 of this code within five years.
(m)  For purposes of determining whether a transfer of land qualifies for the exemption from additional taxes provided by Subsection (f)(4), on an application of the entity transferring or proposing to transfer the land or of the individual or entity to which the land is transferred or proposed to be transferred, the comptroller shall determine the amount of taxes and other revenues likely to be generated as a result of the economic development for deposit in the general revenue fund during the next two fiscal bienniums.  If the comptroller determines that the amount of those revenues is likely to equal or exceed 20 times the amount of additional taxes that would be imposed under Subsection (a) if the sanctions provided by that subsection applied to the transfer, the comptroller shall issue a letter to the applicant stating the comptroller's determination and shall send a copy of the letter by regular mail to the chief appraiser.
(n)  Within one year of the conclusion of the two fiscal bienniums for which the comptroller issued a letter as provided under Subsection (m), the board of directors of the appraisal district, by official board action, may direct the chief appraiser to request the comptroller to determine if the amount of revenues was equal to or exceeded 20 times the amount of taxes that would have been imposed under Subsection (a).  The comptroller shall issue a finding as to whether the amount of revenue met the projected increases.  The chief appraiser shall review the results of the comptroller's finding and shall make a determination as to whether sanctions under Subsection (a) should be imposed.  If the chief appraiser determines that the sanctions provided by Subsection (a) shall be imposed, the sanctions shall be based on the date of the transfer of the property under Subsection (f)(4).
(o)  The sanctions provided by Subsection (a) do not apply to land owned by an organization that qualifies as a charitable organization under Section 
11.18
(c), is organized exclusively to perform religious or charitable purposes, and engages in performing the charitable functions described by Section 
11.18
(d)(19), if the organization converts the land to a use for which the land is eligible for an exemption under Section 
11.18
(d)(19) within five years.
(p)  The sanctions provided by Subsection (a) do not apply to real property transferred to an organization described by Section 
11.181
(a) if the organization converts the real property to a use for which the real property is eligible for an exemption under Section 
11.181
(a). This subsection does not apply to the sanctions provided by Subsection (a) in connection with a change in use described by this subsection that are due to a county or school district unless the governing body of the county or school district, as applicable, waives the sanctions in the manner required by law for official action by the body.
(q)  The sanctions provided by Subsection (a) do not apply to land owned by an organization that qualifies as a school under Section 
11.21
(d) if the organization converts the land to a use for which the land is eligible for an exemption under Section 
11.21
 within five years.

Sec. 23.59.  APPRAISAL OF OPEN-SPACE LAND THAT IS CONVERTED TO TIMBER PRODUCTION.  (a)  If land that has been appraised under this subchapter for at least five preceding years is converted to production of timber after September 1, 1997, the owner may elect to have the land continue to be appraised under this subchapter for 15 years after the date of the conversion, so long as the land qualifies for appraisal as timber land under Subchapter E.  In that event, the land is deemed to be the same category of land under this subchapter as it was immediately before conversion to timber production.
(b)  The election must be made by a new application filed as provided by Section 
23.54
 and remains in effect for 15 years or until a change in use of the land occurs.
(c)  This section applies to the appraisal of land converted to timber production only until the end of the tax year in which the 15th anniversary of the date of the conversion occurs.

Sec. 23.60.  REAPPRAISAL OF LAND SUBJECT TO TEMPORARY QUARANTINE FOR TICKS.  (a)  An owner of qualified open-space land, other than land used for wildlife management, on which the Texas Animal Health Commission has established a temporary quarantine of at least 90 days in length in the current tax year for the purpose of regulating the handling of livestock and eradicating ticks or exposure to ticks at any time during a tax year is entitled to a reappraisal of the owner's land for that year on written request delivered to the chief appraiser.
(b)  As soon as practicable after receiving a request for reappraisal, the chief appraiser shall complete the reappraisal.  In determining the appraised value of the land under Section 
23.52
, the effect on the value of the land caused by the infestation of ticks is an additional factor that must be taken into account.  The appraised value of land reappraised under this section may not exceed the lesser of:
(1)  the market value of the land as determined by other appraisal methods; or
(2)  one-half of the original appraised value of the land for the current tax year.
(c)  A property owner may not be required to pay the appraisal district for the costs of making the reappraisal.  Each taxing unit that participates in the appraisal district and imposes taxes on the land shall share the costs of the reappraisal in the proportion the total dollar amount of taxes imposed by that taxing unit on that land in the preceding year bears to the total dollar amount of taxes all taxing units participating in the appraisal district imposed on that land in the preceding year.
(d)  If land is reappraised as provided by this section, the governing body of each taxing unit that participates in the appraisal district and imposes  taxes on the land shall provide for prorating the taxes on the land for the tax year in which the reappraisal is conducted.  If the taxes are prorated, taxes due on the land are determined as follows:  the taxes on the land based on its value on January 1 of that year are multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days in that year before the date the reappraisal was conducted; the taxes on the land based on its reappraised value are multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is 365 and the numerator of which is the number of days, including the date the reappraisal was conducted, remaining in the year; and the total of the two amounts is the amount of taxes imposed on the land for that year.  Notwithstanding Section 
26.15
, the assessor for each applicable taxing unit shall enter the reappraised value on the appropriate tax roll together with the original appraised value and the calculation of the taxes imposed on the land under this section.  If for any tax year the reappraisal results in a decrease in the tax liability of the landowner, the assessor for the taxing unit shall prepare and mail a new tax bill in the manner provided by Chapter 
31
.  If the owner has paid the tax, each taxing unit that imposed taxes on the land in that year shall promptly refund the difference between the tax paid and the tax due on the lower appraised value.
(e)  In appraising the land for any subsequent tax year in which the Texas Animal Health Commission quarantine remains in place, the chief appraiser shall continue to take into account the effect on the value of the land caused by the infestation of ticks.
(f)  If the owner of the land is informed by the Texas Animal Health Commission that the quarantine is no longer in place, not later than the 30th day after the date on which the owner received that information the owner of the land shall so notify the chief appraiser.  If the owner fails to notify the chief appraiser as required by this subsection, a penalty is imposed on the property equal to 10 percent of the difference between the taxes imposed on the property in each year it is erroneously allowed appraisal under this section and the taxes that would otherwise have been imposed.
(g)  The chief appraiser shall make an entry in the appraisal records for the property against which the penalty is imposed indicating liability for the penalty and shall deliver a written notice of imposition of the penalty to the person who owns the property.  The notice shall include a brief explanation of the procedures for protesting the imposition of the penalty.  The assessor for each taxing unit that imposed taxes on the property on the basis of appraisal under this section shall add the amount of the penalty to the unit's tax bill for taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The penalty shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The amount of the penalty constitutes a lien on the property against which the penalty is imposed and accrues penalty and interest in the same manner as a delinquent tax.

SUBCHAPTER E. APPRAISAL OF TIMBER LAND
Sec. 23.71.  DEFINITIONS.  In this subchapter:
(1)  "Category of the land" means the value classification of land for timber production, based on soil type, soil capability, general topography, weather, location, and other pertinent factors, as determined by competent governmental sources.
(2)  "Net to land" means the average net income that would have been earned by a category of land over the preceding five years by a person using ordinary prudence in the management of the land and the timber produced on the land.  The net income for each year is determined by multiplying the land's potential average annual growth, expressed in tons, by the stumpage value, expressed in price per ton, of large pine sawtimber, small pine sawtimber, pine pulpwood, hardwood sawtimber, hardwood pulpwood, and any other significant timber product, taking into consideration the three forest types and the four different soil types, as determined by using information for the East Texas timber-growing region as a whole from the U.S. Forest Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, the Texas Forest Service, and colleges and universities within this state, and by subtracting from the product reasonable management costs and other reasonable expenses directly attributable to the production of the timber that a prudent manager of the land and timber, seeking to maximize return, would incur in the management of the land and timber.  Stumpage prices shall be determined by using information collected for all types of timber sales, including cutting contract and gatewood sales.

Sec. 23.72.  QUALIFICATION FOR PRODUCTIVITY APPRAISAL.  (a)  Land qualifies for appraisal as provided by this subchapter if it is currently and actively devoted principally to production of timber or forest products to the degree of intensity generally accepted in the area with intent to produce income and has been devoted principally to production of timber or forest products or to agricultural use that would qualify the land for appraisal under Subchapter C or D for five of the preceding seven years.
(b)  In determining whether land is currently and actively devoted principally to the production of timber or forest products to the degree of intensity generally accepted in an area, a chief appraiser may not consider the purpose for which a portion of a parcel of land is used if the portion is:
(1)  used for the production of timber or forest products, including a road, right-of-way, buffer area, or firebreak; or
(2)  subject to a right-of-way that was taken through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
(c)  For the purpose of the appraisal of land under this subchapter, a portion of a parcel of land described by Subsection (b) is considered land that qualifies for appraisal under this subchapter if the remainder of the parcel of land qualifies for appraisal under this subchapter.

(b)  The comptroller by rule shall develop and distribute to each appraisal office appraisal manuals setting forth this method of appraising qualified timber land, and each appraisal office shall use the appraisal manuals in appraising qualified timber land.  The comptroller by rule shall develop and the appraisal office shall enforce procedures to verify that land meets the conditions contained in Section 
23.72
.  The rules, before taking effect, must be approved by the comptroller with the review and counsel of the Texas A&M Forest Service.

Sec. 23.75.  APPLICATION.  (a)  A person claiming that his land is eligible for appraisal as provided by this subchapter must file a valid application with the chief appraiser.
(b)  To be valid, the application must:
(1)  be on a form provided by the appraisal office and prescribed by the comptroller;  and
(2)  contain the information necessary to determine the validity of the claim.
(c)  The comptroller shall include on the form a notice of the penalties prescribed by Section 
37.10
, Penal Code, for making or filing an application containing a false statement.  The comptroller, in prescribing the contents of the application form, shall require that the form permit a claimant who has previously been allowed appraisal under this subchapter to indicate that previously reported information has not changed and to supply only the eligibility information not previously reported.
(d)  The form must be filed before May 1.  However, for good cause the chief appraiser may extend the filing deadline for not more than 60 days.
(e)  If a person fails to file a valid application on time, the land is ineligible for appraisal as provided by this subchapter for that year.  Once an application is filed and appraisal under this subchapter is allowed, the land is eligible for appraisal under this subchapter in subsequent years without a new application unless the ownership of the land changes or its eligibility under this subchapter ends.  However, the chief appraiser if he has good cause to believe the land's eligibility under this subchapter has ended, may require a person allowed appraisal under this subchapter in a prior year to file a new application to confirm that the land is currently eligible under this subchapter by delivering a written notice that a new application is required, accompanied by the application form, to the person who filed the application that was previously allowed.
(f)  The appraisal office shall make a sufficient number of printed application forms readily available at no charge.
(g)  Each year the chief appraiser for each appraisal district shall publicize, in a manner reasonably designed to notify all residents of the district, the requirements of this section and the availability of application forms.
(h)  A person whose land is allowed appraisal under this subchapter shall notify the appraisal office in writing before May 1 after eligibility of the land under this subchapter ends.  If a person fails to notify the appraisal office as required by this subsection a penalty is imposed on the property equal to 10 percent of the difference between the taxes imposed on the property in each year it is erroneously allowed appraisal under this subchapter and the taxes that would otherwise have been imposed.
(i)  The chief appraiser shall make an entry in the appraisal records for the property against which the penalty is imposed indicating liability for the penalty and shall deliver a written notice of imposition of the penalty to the person who owns the property.  The notice shall include a brief explanation of the procedures for protesting the imposition of the penalty.  The assessor for each taxing unit that imposed taxes on the property on the basis of appraisal under this subchapter shall add the amount of the penalty to the unit's tax bill for taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The penalty shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The amount of the penalty constitutes a lien on the property against which the penalty is imposed and accrues penalty and interest in the same manner as a delinquent tax.
(j)  If the chief appraiser discovers that appraisal under this subchapter has been erroneously allowed in any one of the five preceding years because of failure of the person whose land was allowed appraisal under this subchapter to give notice that its eligibility had ended, the chief appraiser shall add the difference between the appraised value of the land under this subchapter and the market value of the land to the appraisal roll as provided by Section 
25.21
 of this code for other property that escapes taxation.

(a)  The chief appraiser shall accept and approve or deny an application for appraisal under this subchapter after the deadline for filing it has passed if it is filed before approval of the appraisal records by the appraisal review board.
(b)  If appraisal under this subchapter is approved when the application is filed late, the owner is liable for a penalty of 10 percent of the difference between the amount of tax imposed on the property and the amount that would be imposed if the property were taxed at market value.
(c)  The chief appraiser shall make an entry on the appraisal records indicating the person's liability for the penalty and shall deliver written notice of imposition of the penalty, explaining the reason for its imposition, to the person.
(d)  The tax assessor for a taxing unit that taxes land based on an appraisal under this subchapter after a late application shall add the amount of the penalty to the owner's tax bill, and the tax collector for the unit shall collect the penalty at the time and in the manner he collects the tax.  The amount of the penalty constitutes a lien against the property against which the penalty is imposed, as if it were a tax, and accrues penalty and interest in the same manner as a delinquent tax.

(c)  The additional tax imposed by this section does not apply to a year for which the tax has already been imposed.
(d)  If the change of use applies to only part of a parcel that has been appraised as provided by this subchapter, the additional tax applies only to that part of the parcel and equals the difference between the taxes imposed on that part of the parcel and the taxes that would have been imposed had that part been taxed on the basis of market value.
(e)  A determination that a change in use of the land has occurred is made by the chief appraiser.  The chief appraiser shall deliver a notice of the determination to the owner of the land as soon as possible after making the determination and shall include in the notice an explanation of the owner's right to protest the determination.  If the owner does not file a timely protest or if the final determination of the protest is that the additional taxes are due, the assessor for each taxing unit shall prepare and deliver a bill for the additional taxes as soon as practicable after the change of use occurs.  The taxes are due and become delinquent and incur penalties and interest as provided by law for ad valorem taxes imposed by the taxing unit if not paid before the next February 1 that is at least 20 days after the date the bill is delivered to the owner of the land.
(f)  The sanctions provided by Subsection (a) do not apply if the change of use occurs as a result of:
(1)  a sale for right-of-way;
(2)  a condemnation;  or
(3)  a transfer of the land to this state or a political subdivision of this state to be used for a public purpose.
(g)  If the use of the land changes to a use that qualifies under Subchapter C, D, or H of this chapter, the sanctions provided by Subsection (a) of this section do not apply.

11.13
.
(i)  The sanctions provided by Subsection (a) do not apply to land owned by an organization that qualifies as a religious organization under Section 
11.20
(c) if the organization converts the land to a use for which the land is eligible for an exemption under Section 
11.20
 within five years.
(j)  The sanctions provided by Subsection (a) do not apply to a change in the use of land if:
(1)  the land is located in an unincorporated area of a county with a population of less than 100,000;
(2)  the land does not exceed five acres;
(3)  the land is owned by a not-for-profit cemetery organization;
(4)  the cemetery organization dedicates the land for a cemetery purpose;
(5)  the cemetery organization has not dedicated more than five acres of land in the county for a cemetery purpose in the five years preceding the date the cemetery organization dedicates the land for a cemetery purpose; and

(c)  The assessor shall prepare and deliver a statement for the additional taxes as soon as practicable after the change of use occurs or the deed restriction expires.

Sec. 23.93.  APPRAISAL OF RESTRICTED LAND.  (a)  A person is entitled to have airport property he owns appraised under this subchapter if, on January 1:
(1)  the property is restricted as provided by this subchapter;
(2)  the property has been devoted exclusively to use as public access airport property for the preceding year;  and
(3)  he is using and intends to use the property exclusively as public access airport property in the current year.
(b)  The chief appraiser may not consider any factor other than one relating to the value of the airport property as restricted.  Sales of comparable airport property not restricted as provided by this subchapter may not be used to determine the value of restricted property.
(c)  Improvements to the property that qualify as public access airport property are appraised as provided by this subchapter, but other improvements and the mineral estate are appraised separately at market value.
(d)  If airport property is appraised under this subchapter for a year, the chief appraiser shall determine at the end of that year whether the property was used exclusively as public access airport property.  If the airport property was not used exclusively as public access airport property, the assessor for each taxing unit shall impose an additional tax equal to the difference in the amount of tax imposed and the amount that would have been imposed for that year if the property had not been restricted to use as public access airport property.  The assessor shall include the amount of additional tax plus interest on the next bill for taxes on the land.
(e)  The comptroller shall promulgate rules specifying the methods to apply and the procedures to use in appraising property under this subchapter.

Sec. 23.94.  APPLICATION.  (a)  A person claiming the right to have his airport property appraised under this subchapter must apply for the right the first year he claims it.  Application for appraisal under this subchapter is made by filing a sworn application form with the chief appraiser for each appraisal district in which the land is located.
(b)  A claimant must deliver a completed application form to the chief appraiser before May 1 and must furnish the information required by the form.  For good cause shown the chief appraiser may extend the deadline for filing the application by written order for a single period not to exceed 60 days.
(c)  If a claimant fails to timely file a completed application form, the property is ineligible for appraisal as provided by this subchapter for that year.  Once an application is filed and appraisal under this subchapter is allowed, the property is eligible for appraisal under this subchapter during the term of the deed restriction without a new application unless the ownership of the property changes or its eligibility under this subchapter ends.  However, the chief appraiser, if he has good cause to believe the property's eligibility under this subchapter has ended, may require a person allowed appraisal under this subchapter in a prior year to file a new application to confirm that the property is currently eligible under this subchapter by delivering a written notice that a new application is required, accompanied by the application form, to the person who filed the application that was previously allowed.
(d)  A person whose property is allowed appraisal under this subchapter shall notify the appraisal office in writing before May 1 after eligibility of the property under this subchapter ends.
(e)  If the chief appraiser discovers that appraisal under this subchapter has been erroneously allowed in any one of the five preceding years, the chief appraiser shall add the difference between the appraised value of the property under this subchapter and the value of the property if it had not been restricted to use as public access airport property to the appraisal roll as provided by Section 
25.21
 of this code for other property that escapes taxation.
(f)  The comptroller in prescribing the contents of the application forms shall ensure that each form requires a claimant to furnish the information necessary to determine the validity of the claim and that the form requires the claimant to state that the airport property for which he claims appraisal under this subchapter will be used exclusively as public access airport property in the current year.

(1)  approve the application and allow appraisal under this subchapter;
(2)  disapprove the application and request additional information from the claimant in support of the claim; or
(3)  deny the application.
(b)  If the chief appraiser requires additional information from a claimant, the chief appraiser shall, as soon as practicable but not later than the 30th day after the date the application is filed with the chief appraiser, deliver a written notice to the claimant specifying the additional information the claimant must provide to the chief appraiser before the chief appraiser can determine the claimant's right to appraisal under this subchapter.  The claimant must furnish the information not later than the 30th day after the date of the request or before April 15, whichever is earlier, or the application is denied.  However, for good cause shown the chief appraiser may extend the deadline for furnishing additional information by written order for a single period not to exceed 15 days.
(c)  The chief appraiser shall determine the validity of each application for appraisal under this subchapter filed with him before he submits the appraisal records for review and determination of protests as provided by Chapter 
41
 of this code.
(d)  If the chief appraiser denies an application, the chief appraiser shall deliver a written notice of the denial to the claimant not later than the fifth day after the date of denial.  The notice must state and fully explain each reason the chief appraiser denied the application. The notice must include a brief explanation of the procedures for protesting the denial.

Sec. 23.96.  TAXATION FOR PRECEDING YEARS.  (a)  If airport property that has been appraised under this subchapter is no longer subject to a deed restriction, an additional tax is imposed on the property equal to the difference between the taxes imposed on the property for each of the three years preceding the year in which the deed restriction expires that the property was appraised as provided by this subchapter and the tax that would have been imposed had the property not been restricted to use as public access airport property in each of those years.
(b)  A tax lien attaches to the property on the date the deed restriction expires to secure payment of the additional tax imposed by this section and any penalties and interest incurred if the tax becomes delinquent.  The lien exists in favor of all taxing units for which the additional tax is imposed.
(c)  The assessor shall prepare and deliver a statement for the additional taxes as soon as practicable after the deed restriction expires.  The taxes become delinquent and incur penalties and interest as provided by law for ad valorem taxes imposed by the taxing unit if not paid before the next date on which the unit's taxes become delinquent that is more than 10 days after the date the statement is delivered.
(d)  The sanctions provided by Subsection (a) of this section do not apply if the change of use occurs as a result of a sale for right-of-way or a condemnation.

Sec. 23.97.  PENALTY FOR VIOLATING DEED RESTRICTION.  (a)  If airport property appraised under this subchapter is used as other than public access airport property before the term of the deed restriction expires, a penalty is imposed on the property equal to the difference between the taxes imposed on the property on the basis of appraisal under this subchapter for the year in which the violation occurs and the amount that would have been imposed for that year had the property not been restricted to use as public access airport property.
(b)  The chief appraiser shall make an entry in the appraisal records for the property against which the penalty is imposed indicating liability for the penalty and shall deliver a written notice of imposition of the penalty to the person who filed the application for appraisal under this subchapter.  The notice shall include a brief explanation of the procedures for protesting the imposition of the penalty.
(c)  The assessor for each taxing unit that imposed taxes on the property on the basis of appraisal under this subchapter shall add the amount of the penalty to the unit's tax bill for taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The county assessor-collector shall add the amount of the penalty to the county's tax bill for taxes on the property.  The penalty shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The amount of the penalty constitutes a lien on the property against which the penalty is imposed and accrues penalty and interest in the same manner as a delinquent tax.

Sec. 23.9804.  APPLICATION.  (a)  A person claiming that the person's land is eligible for appraisal as provided by this subchapter must file a valid application with the chief appraiser.
(b)  To be valid, an application for appraisal under Section 
23.9802
(a) must:
(1)  be on a form provided by the appraisal office and prescribed by the comptroller;
(2)  provide evidence that the land qualifies for designation as an aesthetic management zone, critical wildlife habitat zone, or streamside management zone;
(3)  specify the location of the proposed zone and the quantity of land, in acres, in the proposed zone;  and
(4)  contain other information necessary to determine the validity of the claim.
(c)  To be valid, an application for appraisal under Section 
23.9802
(b) must:
(1)  be on a form provided by the appraisal office and prescribed by the comptroller;
(2)  provide evidence that the land on which the timber was harvested was appraised under Subchapter E in the year in which the timber was harvested;

37.10
, Penal Code, for making or filing an application containing a false statement.  The comptroller, in prescribing the contents of the application form, shall require that the form permit a claimant who has previously been allowed appraisal under this subchapter to indicate that the previously reported information has not changed and to supply only the eligibility information not previously reported.
(e)  The form must be filed before May 1.  However, for good cause shown, the chief appraiser may extend the filing deadline for not more than 15 days.
(f)  If a person fails to file a valid application on time, the land is ineligible for appraisal as provided by this subchapter for that year.  Once an application is filed and appraisal under this subchapter is allowed, the land is eligible for appraisal under the applicable provision of this subchapter in subsequent years without a new application unless the ownership of the land changes, the standing timber is harvested, or the land's eligibility under this subchapter ends.  However, if the chief appraiser has good cause to believe the land's eligibility under this subchapter has ended, the chief appraiser may require a person allowed appraisal under this subchapter in a previous year to file a new application to confirm that the land is currently eligible under this subchapter by delivering a written notice that a new application is required, accompanied by the application form, to the person who filed the application that was previously allowed.
(g)  The appraisal office shall make a sufficient number of printed application forms readily available at no charge.
(h)  Each year the chief appraiser for each appraisal district shall publicize, in a manner reasonably designed to notify all residents of the district, the requirements of this section and the availability of application forms.

(j)  The chief appraiser shall make an entry in the appraisal records for the property against which the penalty is imposed indicating liability for the penalty and shall deliver a written notice of imposition of the penalty to the person who owns the property.  The notice shall include a brief explanation of the procedures for protesting the imposition of the penalty.  The assessor for each taxing unit that imposed taxes on the property on the basis of appraisal under this subchapter shall add the amount of the penalty to the unit's tax bill for taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The penalty shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the taxes on the property against which the penalty is imposed.  The amount of the penalty constitutes a lien on the property against which the penalty is imposed and on delinquency accrues penalty and interest in the same manner as a delinquent tax.
(k)  If the chief appraiser discovers that appraisal under this subchapter has been erroneously allowed in any of the 10 preceding years because of failure of the person whose land was allowed appraisal under this subchapter to give notice that the land's eligibility had ended, the chief appraiser shall add the difference between the appraised value of the land under this subchapter and the market value of the land for any year in which the land was ineligible for appraisal under this subchapter to the appraisal records as provided by Section 
25.21
 for other property that escapes taxation.

(b)  The chief appraiser shall notify the landowner and each taxing unit in which the land is located that a determination letter has been requested.
(c)  The director's letter is conclusive as to the type, size, and location of the zone for purposes of appraisal of the land under this subchapter.
(d)  If the land is located in a zone described in the determination letter, the chief appraiser shall approve the application and allow appraisal under this subchapter if the applicant is otherwise entitled to have the applicant's land appraised under this subchapter.
(e)  The director of the Texas Forest Service by rule shall adopt procedures under this section.  The procedures must allow the chief appraiser, the landowner, and a representative of each taxing unit in which the land is located to present information to the director before the director issues the determination letter.

Sec. 23.9807.  CHANGE OF USE OF LAND.  (a)  If the use of land that has been appraised as provided by this subchapter changes to a use that qualifies the land for appraisal under Subchapter E, an additional tax is imposed on the land equal to  the difference between:
(1)  the taxes imposed on the land for each of the three years preceding the year in which the change of use occurs that the land was appraised as provided by this subchapter; and
(2)  the taxes that would have been imposed had the land been appraised under Subchapter E in each of those years.
(b)  If the use of land that has been appraised as provided by this subchapter changes to a use that does not qualify the land for appraisal under Subchapter E or under this subchapter, an additional tax is imposed on the land equal to  the difference between:
(1)  the taxes imposed on the land for each of the three years preceding the year in which the change of use occurs that the land was appraised as provided by this subchapter; and
(2)  the taxes that would have been imposed had the land been taxed on the basis of market value in each of those years.
(c)  A tax lien attaches to the land on the date the change of use occurs to secure payment of the additional tax imposed by this section and any penalties and interest incurred if the tax becomes delinquent.  The lien exists in favor of all taxing units for which the additional tax is imposed.
(d)  The additional tax imposed by this section does not apply to a year for which the tax has already been imposed.
(e)  If the change of use applies to only part of a parcel that has been appraised as provided by this subchapter, the additional tax applies only to that part of the parcel.
(f)  A determination that a change in use of the land has occurred is made by the chief appraiser.  The chief appraiser shall deliver a notice of the determination to the owner of the land as soon as possible after making the determination and shall include in the notice an explanation of the owner's right to protest the determination.  If the owner does not file a timely protest or if the final determination of the protest is that the additional taxes are due, the assessor for each taxing unit shall prepare and deliver a bill for the additional taxes as soon as practicable after the change of use occurs.  The taxes are due and become delinquent and incur penalties and interest as provided by law for ad valorem taxes imposed by the taxing unit if not paid before the next February 1 that is at least 20 days after the date the bill is delivered to the owner of the land.
(g)  The harvesting of timber from the land before the expiration of the period provided by Section 
23.9802
(c) constitutes a change of use of the land for purposes of this section.
(h)  The sanction provided by Subsection (a) or (b) does not apply if the change of use occurs as a result of a:
(1)  sale for right-of-way;
(2)  condemnation;  or

(c)  Each appraisal record must have a unique account number.  If an appraisal district changes the account number of an appraisal record, the appraisal district must provide written notice of the change to the property owner as soon as practicable after the change and provide notice of the change in the next notice of appraised value of the property included in the record that is delivered to the property owner under Section

25.25
 or a protest filed under Chapter 
41
.
(g)  The combination of contiguous parcels or tracts of real property into a single appraisal record or the separation of identifiable segments of a parcel or tract of real property into individual appraisal records under this section does not affect the application of generally accepted appraisal methods and techniques to the appraisal of real property associated with those appraisal records, including real property that is part of the same economic unit as real property contained in the same or another appraisal record.

 if the applicant or recipient is disabled or is 65 or older or an exemption authorized by Section 
11.13
(q), 
11.131
, or 
11.22
, or a clerical error or other inaccuracy as prescribed by board rule that does not increase the amount of tax liability.

The report must include:
(1)  a description of each property; and
(2)  the name of the owner of that property.
(c)  The appraisal review board, on motion of the chief appraiser or of a property owner, may direct by written order changes in the appraisal roll for any of the five preceding years to correct:
(1)  clerical errors that affect a property owner's liability for a tax imposed in that tax year;
(2)  multiple appraisals of a property in that tax year;
(3)  the inclusion of property that does not exist in the form or at the location described in the appraisal roll; or
(4)  an error in which property is shown as owned by a person who did not own the property on January 1 of that tax year.
(c-1)  The appraisal review board, on motion of the chief appraiser or of a property owner, may direct by written order changes in the appraisal roll or related appraisal records for the current tax year and for either of the two preceding tax years to correct an inaccuracy in the appraised value of the owner's tangible personal property that is the result of an error or omission in a rendition statement or property report filed under Chapter 
22

(1)  the property owner failed to timely file the rendition statement or property report in accordance with Section 
22.23
 and was assessed a penalty under Section 
22.28
;
(2)  the property was the subject of a protest brought by the property owner under Chapter 
41
, a hearing on the protest was conducted in which the owner offered evidence or argument, and the appraisal review board made a determination of the protest on the merits;
(3)  the property was the subject of a previous motion filed by the property owner under this section and the chief appraiser and the owner agreed to the correction, the appraisal review board determined the motion, or the appraisal review board determined that the owner forfeited the right to a final determination of the motion for failing to comply with the prepayment requirements of Section 
25.26
; or
(4)  the appraised value of the property was established as a result of a written agreement between the property owner or the owner's agent and the appraisal district.
(d)  At any time prior to the date the taxes become delinquent, a property owner or the chief appraiser may file a motion with the appraisal review board to change the appraisal roll to correct an error that resulted in an incorrect appraised value for the owner's property.  However, the error may not be corrected unless it resulted in an appraised value that exceeds by more than:
(1)  one-fourth the correct appraised value, in the case of property that qualifies as the owner's residence homestead under Section 
11.13
; or
(2)  one-third the correct appraised value, in the case of property that does not qualify as the owner's residence homestead under Section 
11.13
.
(d-1)  If the appraisal roll is changed under Subsection (d), the property owner must pay to each affected taxing unit a late-correction penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of taxes as calculated on the basis of the corrected appraised value.  Payment of the late-correction penalty is secured by the lien that attaches to the property under Section 
32.01
 and is subject to enforced collection under Chapter 
33
.  The roll may not be changed under Subsection (d) if:
(1)  the property was the subject of a protest brought by the property owner under Chapter 
41
, a hearing on the protest was conducted in which the property owner offered evidence or argument, and the appraisal review board made a determination of the protest on the merits; or
(2)  the appraised value of the property was established as a result of a written agreement between the property owner or the owner's agent and the appraisal district.
(e)  If the chief appraiser and the property owner do not agree to the correction before the 15th day after the date the motion is filed, a party bringing a motion under Subsection (c), (c-1), or (d) is entitled on request to a hearing on and a determination of the motion by the appraisal review board.  A party bringing a motion under this section must describe the error or errors that the motion is seeking to correct.  If a request for hearing is made on or after January 1 but before  September 1, the appraisal review board shall schedule the hearing to be held as soon as practicable but not later than the 90th day after the date the board approves the appraisal records as provided by Section 
41.12
.  If a request for hearing is made on or after September 1 but before January 1 of the following tax year, the appraisal review board shall schedule the hearing to be held as soon as practicable but not later than the 90th day after the date the request for the hearing is made.  Not later than 15 days before the date of the hearing, the board shall deliver written notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing to the chief appraiser, the property owner, and the presiding officer of the governing body of each taxing unit in which the property is located.  The chief appraiser, the property owner, and each taxing unit are entitled to present evidence and argument at the hearing and to receive written notice of the board's determination of the motion.

(g)  Within 60 days after receiving notice of the appraisal review board's determination of a motion under this section or of a determination of the appraisal review board that the property owner has forfeited the right to a final determination of a motion under this section for failing to comply with the prepayment requirements of Section 
25.26
, the property owner or the chief appraiser may file suit to compel the board to order a change in the appraisal roll as required by this section.  A taxing unit may not be made a party to a suit filed by a property owner or chief appraiser under this subsection.
(g-1)  In a suit filed under Subsection (g), if a hearing to review and determine compliance with Section 
25.26
 is requested, the movant must mail notice of the hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the collector for each taxing unit that imposes taxes on the property not later than the 45th day before the date of the hearing.
(g-2)  Regardless of whether the collector for the taxing unit receives a notice under Subsection (g-1), a taxing unit that imposes taxes on the property may intervene in a suit filed under Subsection (g) and participate in the proceedings for the limited purpose of determining whether the property owner has complied with Section 
25.26
.  The taxing unit is entitled to process for witnesses and evidence and to be heard by the court.
(h)  The appraisal review board, on the joint motion of the property owner and the chief appraiser filed at any time prior to the date the taxes become delinquent, shall by written order correct an error that resulted in an incorrect appraised value for the owner's property.
(i)  A person who acquires property after January 1 of the tax year at issue is entitled to file any motion that this section authorizes the person who owned the property on January 1 of that year to file, if the deadline for filing the motion has not passed.
(j)  If during the pendency of a motion under this section the ownership of property subject to the motion changes, the new owner of the property is entitled to proceed with the motion in the same manner as the property owner who filed the motion.

(m)  The hearing on a motion under Subsection (c), (c-1), or (d) shall be conducted in the manner provided by Subchapter

26.15
(f), and any penalty or interest on those taxes, is limited to taxes paid for the tax year in which the appraisal roll is changed and the four tax years preceding that year.
(o)  The failure or refusal of a chief appraiser to change an appraisal roll under Subsection (b) is not:
(1)  an action that the appraisal review board is authorized to determine under this section;
(2)  an action that may be the subject of a suit to compel filed under Subsection (g);
(3)  an action that a property owner is entitled to protest under Section 
41.41
;  or
(4)  an action that may be appealed under Chapter 
42
.

Sec. 25.26.  FORFEITURE OF REMEDY FOR NONPAYMENT OF TAXES.  (a)  The pendency of a motion filed under Section 
25.25
 does not affect the delinquency date for the taxes on the property that is the subject of the motion.  However, that delinquency date applies only to the amount of taxes required to be paid under Subsection (b).  If the property owner complies with Subsection (b), the delinquency date for any additional amount of taxes due on the property is determined in the manner provided by Section 
42.42
(c) for the determination of the delinquency date for additional taxes finally determined to be due in an appeal under Chapter 
42
, and that additional amount is not delinquent before that date.
(b)  Except as provided by Subsection (d), a property owner who files a motion under Section 
25.25
 must pay the amount of taxes due on the portion of the taxable value of the property that is the subject of the motion that is not in dispute before the delinquency date or the property owner forfeits the right to proceed to a final determination of the motion.
(c)  A property owner who pays an amount of taxes greater than that required by Subsection (b) does not forfeit the property owner's right to a final determination of the motion by making the payment.  If the property owner files a timely motion under Section 
25.25
, taxes paid on the property are considered paid under protest, even if paid before the motion is filed.
(d)  After filing an oath of inability to pay the taxes at issue, a property owner may be excused from the requirement of prepayment of tax as a prerequisite to the determination of a motion if the appraisal review board, after notice and hearing, finds that such prepayment would constitute an unreasonable restraint on the property owner's right of access to the board.  On the motion of a party, the board shall determine compliance with this section in the same manner and by the same procedure as provided by Section 
41.4115
(d) and may set such terms and conditions on any grant of relief as may be reasonably required by the circumstances.

CHAPTER 26. ASSESSMENT
Sec. 26.01.  SUBMISSION OF ROLLS TO TAXING UNITS.  (a)  By July 25, the chief appraiser shall prepare and certify to the assessor for each taxing unit participating in the district that part of the appraisal roll for the district that lists the property taxable by the unit.  The part certified to the assessor is the appraisal roll for the unit.  The chief appraiser shall consult with the assessor for each taxing unit and notify each unit in writing by April 1 of the form in which the roll will be provided to each unit.
(a-1)  If by July 20 the appraisal review board for an appraisal district has not approved the appraisal records for the district as required under Section 
41.12
, the chief appraiser shall not later than July 25 prepare and certify to the assessor for each taxing unit participating in the district an estimate of the taxable value of property in that taxing unit.
(b)  When a chief appraiser submits an appraisal roll for county taxes to a county assessor-collector, the chief appraiser also shall certify the appraisal district appraisal roll to the comptroller.  However, the comptroller by rule may provide for submission of only a summary of the appraisal roll.  The chief appraiser shall certify the district appraisal roll or the summary of that roll in the form and manner prescribed by the comptroller's rule.
(c)  The chief appraiser shall prepare and certify to the assessor for each taxing unit a listing of those properties which are taxable by that unit but which are under protest and therefore not included on the appraisal roll approved by the appraisal review board and certified by the chief appraiser.  This listing shall include the appraised market value, productivity value (if applicable), and taxable value as determined by the appraisal district and shall also include the market value, taxable value, and productivity value (if applicable) as claimed by the property owner filing the protest if available.  If the property owner does not claim a value and the appraised value of the property in the current year is equal to or less than its value in the preceding year, the listing shall include a reasonable estimate of the market value, taxable value, and productivity value (if applicable) that would be assigned to the property if the taxpayer's claim is upheld.  If the property owner does not claim a value and the appraised value of the property is higher than its appraised value in the preceding year, the listing shall include the appraised market value, productivity value (if applicable) and taxable value of the property in the preceding year, except that if there is a reasonable likelihood that the appraisal review board will approve a lower appraised value for the property than its appraised value in the preceding year, the chief appraiser shall make a reasonable estimate of the taxable value that would be assigned to the property if the property owner's claim is upheld.  The taxing unit shall use the lower value for calculations as prescribed in Sections 
26.04
 and 
26.041
 of this code.
(d)  The chief appraiser shall prepare and certify to the assessor for each taxing unit a list of those properties of which the chief appraiser has knowledge that are reasonably likely to be taxable by that unit but that are not included on the appraisal roll certified to the assessor under Subsection (a) or included on the listing certified to the assessor under Subsection (c).  The chief appraiser shall include on the list for each property the market value, appraised value, and kind and amount of any partial exemptions as determined by the appraisal district for the preceding year and a reasonable estimate of the market value, appraised value, and kind and amount of any partial exemptions for the current year.  Until the property is added to the appraisal roll, the assessor for the taxing unit shall include each property on the list in the calculations prescribed by Sections 
26.04
 and 
26.041
, and for that purpose shall use the lower market value, appraised value, or taxable value, as appropriate, included on or computed using the information included on the list for the property.
(e)  Except as provided by Subsection (f), not later than April 30, the chief appraiser shall prepare and certify to the assessor for each county, municipality, and school district participating in the appraisal district an estimate of the taxable value of property in that taxing unit.  The chief appraiser shall assist each county, municipality, and school district in determining values of property in that taxing unit for the taxing unit's budgetary purposes.

(b), contact information for the assessor for each taxing unit in which the property is located, who must provide the information described by this subsection to the owner on request;
(3)  the name, address, and telephone number of the county assessor-collector for the county in which the property is located or, if the county assessor-collector does not assess taxes for the county, the person who assesses taxes for the county under Section 
6.24
(b); and 
(4)  instructions describing how a property owner may register on the appraisal district's Internet website, if the appraisal district maintains an Internet website, to have notifications regarding updates to the property tax database delivered to the owner by e-mail.
(e-3)  The statement described by Subsection (e-2)(1) must include a heading that is in bold, capital letters in type larger than that used in the other provisions of the notice.
(e-4)  The comptroller:
(1)  with the advice of the property tax administration advisory board, shall adopt rules prescribing the form of the notice required by Subsection (e-2); and
(2)  may adopt rules regarding the format, posting, and publication of the notice.
(e-5)  The governing body of a taxing unit shall include as an appendix to the taxing unit's budget for a fiscal year the tax rate calculation forms used by the designated officer or employee of the taxing unit to calculate the no-new-revenue tax rate and the voter-approval tax rate of the taxing unit for the tax year in which the fiscal year begins.
(e-6)  By August 7 or as soon thereafter as practicable, the chief appraiser of each appraisal district shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the county for which the appraisal district is established the notice required by Subsection (e-2).  If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the county for which the appraisal district is established, the notice shall be posted at the appraisal office for the district.
(f)  If as a result of consolidation of taxing units a taxing unit includes territory that was in two or more taxing units in the preceding year, the amount of taxes imposed in each in the preceding year is combined for purposes of calculating the no-new-revenue and voter-approval tax rates under this section.
(g)  A person who owns taxable property is entitled to an injunction prohibiting the taxing unit in which the property is taxable from adopting a tax rate if the assessor or designated officer or employee of the taxing unit, the chief appraiser of the applicable appraisal district, or the taxing unit, as applicable, has not complied with the computation, publication, or posting requirements of this section or Section 
26.16
, 
26.17
, or 
26.18
.  It is a defense in an action for an injunction under this subsection that the failure to comply was in good faith.
(h)  For purposes of this section, the anticipated collection rate of a taxing unit is the percentage relationship that the total amount of estimated tax collections for the current year bears to the total amount of taxes imposed for the current year.  The total amount of estimated tax collections for the current year is the sum of the collector's estimate of:
(1)  the total amount of property taxes imposed in the current year that will be collected before July 1 of the following year, including any penalties and interest on those taxes that will be collected during that period; and
(2)  the total amount of delinquent property taxes imposed in previous years that will be collected on or after July 1 of the current year and before July 1 of the following year, including any penalties and interest on those taxes that will be collected during that period.
(h-1)  Notwithstanding Subsection (h), if the anticipated collection rate of a taxing unit as calculated under that subsection is lower than the lowest actual collection rate of the taxing unit for any of the preceding three years, the anticipated collection rate of the taxing unit for purposes of this section is equal to the lowest actual collection rate of the taxing unit for any of the preceding three years.
(h-2)  The anticipated collection rate of a taxing unit for purposes of this section is the rate calculated under Subsection (h) as modified by Subsection (h-1), if applicable, regardless of whether that rate exceeds 100 percent.
(i)  This subsection applies to a taxing unit that has agreed by written contract to transfer a distinct department, function, or activity to another taxing unit and discontinues operating that distinct department, function, or activity if the operation of that department, function, or activity in all or a majority of the territory of the taxing unit is continued by another existing taxing unit or by a new taxing unit.  The voter-approval tax rate of a taxing unit to which this subsection applies in the first tax year in which a budget is adopted that does not allocate revenue to the discontinued department, function, or activity is calculated as otherwise provided by this section, except that last year's levy used to calculate the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate of the taxing unit is reduced by the amount of maintenance and operations tax revenue spent by the taxing unit to operate the department, function, or activity for the 12 months preceding the month in which the calculations required by this chapter are made and in which the taxing unit operated the discontinued department, function, or activity.  If the taxing unit did not operate that department, function, or activity for the full 12 months preceding the month in which the calculations required by this chapter are made, the taxing unit shall reduce last year's levy used for calculating the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate of the taxing unit by the amount of the revenue spent in the last full fiscal year in which the taxing unit operated the discontinued department, function, or activity.
(j)  This subsection applies to a taxing unit that had agreed by written contract to accept the transfer of a distinct department, function, or activity from another taxing unit and operates a distinct department, function, or activity if the operation of a substantially similar department, function, or activity in all or a majority of the territory of the taxing unit has been discontinued by another taxing unit, including a dissolved taxing unit.  The voter-approval tax rate of a taxing unit to which this subsection applies in the first tax year after the other taxing unit discontinued the substantially similar department, function, or activity in which a budget is adopted that allocates revenue to the department, function, or activity is calculated as otherwise provided by this section, except that last year's levy used to calculate the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate of the taxing unit is increased by the amount of maintenance and operations tax revenue spent by the taxing unit that discontinued operating the substantially similar department, function, or activity to operate that department, function, or activity for the 12 months preceding the month in which the calculations required by this chapter are made and in which the taxing unit operated the discontinued department, function, or activity.  If the taxing unit did not operate the discontinued department, function, or activity for the full 12 months preceding the month in which the calculations required by this chapter are made, the taxing unit may increase last year's levy used to calculate the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate by an amount not to exceed the amount of property tax revenue spent by the discontinuing taxing unit to operate the discontinued department, function, or activity in the last full fiscal year in which the discontinuing taxing unit operated the department, function, or activity.

Sec. 26.041.  TAX RATE OF UNIT IMPOSING ADDITIONAL SALES AND USE TAX.  (a)  In the first year in which an additional sales and use tax is required to be collected, the no-new-revenue tax rate and voter-approval tax rate for the taxing unit are calculated according to the following formulas:
NO-NEW-REVENUE TAX RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S LEVY - LOST PROPERTY LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] - SALES TAX GAIN RATE
 and
VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE FOR SPECIAL TAXING UNIT = (NO-NEW-REVENUE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE x 1.08) + (CURRENT DEBT RATE - SALES TAX GAIN RATE)
or
VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE FOR TAXING UNIT OTHER THAN SPECIAL TAXING UNIT = (NO-NEW-REVENUE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE x 1.035) + (CURRENT DEBT RATE + UNUSED INCREMENT RATE - SALES TAX GAIN RATE)
where "sales tax gain rate" means a number expressed in dollars per $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the revenue that will be generated by the additional sales and use tax in the following year as calculated under Subsection (d) by the current total value.
(b)  Except as provided by Subsections (a) and (c), in a year in which a taxing unit imposes an additional sales and use tax, the voter-approval tax rate for the taxing unit is calculated according to the following formula, regardless of whether the taxing unit levied a property tax in the preceding year:
VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE FOR SPECIAL TAXING UNIT = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.08) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + (CURRENT DEBT RATE - SALES TAX REVENUE RATE)
or
VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE FOR TAXING UNIT OTHER THAN SPECIAL TAXING UNIT = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.035) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + (CURRENT DEBT RATE + UNUSED INCREMENT RATE - SALES TAX REVENUE RATE)
where "last year's maintenance and operations expense" means the amount spent for maintenance and operations from property tax and additional sales and use tax revenues in the preceding year, and "sales tax revenue rate" means a number expressed in dollars per $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the revenue that will be generated by the additional sales and use tax in the current year as calculated under Subsection (d) by the current total value.
(c)  In a year in which a taxing unit that has been imposing an additional sales and use tax ceases to impose an additional sales and use tax, the no-new-revenue tax rate and voter-approval tax rate for the taxing unit are calculated according to the following formulas:
NO-NEW-REVENUE TAX RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S LEVY - LOST PROPERTY LEVY) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + SALES TAX LOSS RATE
and
VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE FOR SPECIAL TAXING UNIT = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.08) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + CURRENT DEBT RATE
or
VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE FOR TAXING UNIT OTHER THAN SPECIAL TAXING UNIT = [(LAST YEAR'S MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS EXPENSE x 1.035) / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)] + (CURRENT DEBT RATE + UNUSED INCREMENT RATE)
where "sales tax loss rate" means a number expressed in dollars per $100 of taxable value, calculated by dividing the amount of sales and use tax revenue generated in the last four quarters for which the information is available by the current total value and "last year's maintenance and operations expense" means the amount spent for maintenance and operations from property tax and additional sales and use tax revenues in the preceding year.
(c-1)  Repealed by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 884 (S.B. 
1438
), Sec. 10(3), eff. June 16, 2021.
(d)  In order to determine the amount of additional sales and use tax revenue for purposes of this section, the designated officer or employee shall use the sales and use tax revenue for the last preceding four quarters for which the information is available as the basis for projecting the additional sales and use tax revenue for the current tax year. If the rate of the additional sales and use tax is increased or reduced, the projection to be used for the first tax year after the effective date of the sales and use tax change shall be adjusted to exclude any revenue gained or lost because of the sales and use tax rate change.  If the unit did not impose an additional sales and use tax for the last preceding four quarters, the designated officer or employee shall request the comptroller of public accounts to provide to the officer or employee a report showing the estimated amount of taxable sales and uses within the unit for the previous four quarters as compiled by the comptroller, and the comptroller shall comply with the request.  The officer or employee shall prepare the estimate of the additional sales and use tax revenue for the first year of the imposition of the tax by multiplying the amount reported by the comptroller by the appropriate additional sales and use tax rate and by multiplying that product by .95.
(e)  If a city that imposes an additional sales and use tax receives payments under the terms of a contract executed before January 1, 1986, in which the city agrees not to annex certain property or a certain area and the owners or lessees of the property or of property in the area agree to pay at least annually to the city an amount determined by reference to all or a percentage of the property tax rate of the city and all or a part of the value of the property subject to the agreement or included in the area subject to the agreement, the governing body, by order adopted by a majority vote of the governing body, may direct the designated officer or employee to add to the no-new-revenue and voter-approval tax rates the amount that, when applied to the total taxable value submitted to the governing body, would produce an amount of taxes equal to the difference between the total amount of payments for the tax year under contracts described by this subsection under the voter-approval tax rate calculated under this section and the total amount of payments for the tax year that would have been obligated to the city if the city had not adopted an additional sales and use tax.
(f)  An estimate made by the comptroller under Subsection (d) of this section need not be adjusted to take into account any projection of additional revenue attributable to increases in the total value of items taxable under the state sales and use tax because of amendments of Chapter 
151
, Tax Code.
(g)  If the rate of the additional sales and use tax is increased, the designated officer or employee shall make two projections, in the manner provided by Subsection (d), of the revenue generated by the additional sales and use tax in the following year.  The first projection must take into account the increase and the second projection must not take into account the increase.  The designated officer or employee shall then subtract the amount of the result of the second projection from the amount of the result of the first projection to determine the revenue generated as a result of the increase in the additional sales and use tax.  In the first year in which an additional sales and use tax is increased, the no-new-revenue tax rate for the taxing unit is the no-new-revenue tax rate before the increase minus a number the numerator of which is the revenue generated as a result of the increase in the additional sales and use tax, as determined under this subsection, and the denominator of which is the current total value minus the new property value.
(h)  If the rate of the additional sales and use tax is decreased, the designated officer or employee shall make two projections, in the manner provided by Subsection (d), of the revenue generated by the additional sales and use tax in the following year.  The first projection must take into account the decrease and the second projection must not take into account the decrease.  The designated officer or employee shall then subtract the amount of the result of the first projection from the amount of the result of the second projection to determine the revenue lost as a result of the decrease in the additional sales and use tax.  In the first year in which an additional sales and use tax is decreased, the no-new-revenue tax rate for the taxing unit is the no-new-revenue tax rate before the decrease plus a number the numerator of which is the revenue lost as a result of the decrease in the additional sales and use tax, as determined under this subsection, and the denominator of which is the current total value minus the new property value.
(i)  Any amount derived from the sales and use tax that is or will be distributed by a county to the recipient of an economic development grant made under Chapter 
381
, Local Government Code, is not considered to be sales and use tax revenue for purposes of this section.
(j)  Any amount derived from the sales and use tax that is retained by the comptroller under Chapters 
476
 or 
477
, Government Code, is not considered to be sales and use tax revenue for purposes of this section.

Sec. 26.042.  CALCULATION AND ADOPTION OF CERTAIN TAX RATES IN DISASTER AREA.  (a)  Notwithstanding Sections 
26.04
 and 
26.041
, the governing body of a taxing unit other than a school district or a special taxing unit may direct the designated officer or employee to calculate the voter-approval tax rate of the taxing unit in the manner provided for a special taxing unit if any part of the taxing unit is located in an area declared a disaster area during the current tax year by the governor or by the president of the United States and at least one person is granted an exemption under Section 
11.35
 for property located in the taxing unit.  The designated officer or employee shall continue calculating the voter-approval tax rate in the manner provided by this subsection until the earlier of:
(1)  the first tax year in which the total taxable value of property taxable by the taxing unit as shown on the appraisal roll for the taxing unit submitted by the assessor for the taxing unit to the governing body exceeds the total taxable value of property taxable by the taxing unit on January 1 of the tax year in which the disaster occurred; or
(2)  the third tax year after the tax year in which the disaster occurred.
(b)  In the first tax year following the last tax year for which the designated officer or employee calculates a taxing unit's voter-approval tax rate in the manner provided by Subsection (a), the taxing unit's voter-approval tax rate is reduced by the taxing unit's emergency revenue rate.  For purposes of this subsection, a taxing unit's emergency revenue rate means a rate expressed in dollars per $100 of taxable value calculated according to the following formula:
EMERGENCY REVENUE RATE = [(LAST YEAR'S ADOPTED TAX RATE - ADJUSTED VOTER-APPROVAL TAX RATE) x LAST YEAR'S TOTAL VALUE] / (CURRENT TOTAL VALUE - NEW PROPERTY VALUE)
(c)  For purposes of Subsection (b), "adjusted voter-approval tax rate" means the voter-approval tax rate a taxing unit would have calculated in the last year for which Subsection (a) applied to the taxing unit if in each tax year Subsection (a) applied to the taxing unit the taxing unit adopted a tax rate equal to the greater of:
(1)  the tax rate actually adopted by the taxing unit for that tax year, if that tax rate was approved by the voters at an election held under Section 
26.07
; or
(2)  the taxing unit's voter-approval tax rate for that tax year, calculated in the manner provided for a taxing unit other than a special taxing unit.
(d)  When increased expenditure of money by a taxing unit other than a school district is necessary to respond to a disaster, including a tornado, hurricane, flood, wildfire, or other calamity, but not including a drought, epidemic, or pandemic, that has impacted the taxing unit and the governor has declared any part of the area in which the taxing unit is located as a disaster area, an election is not required under Section 
26.07
 to approve the tax rate adopted by the governing body for the year following the year in which the disaster occurs.
(e)  When increased expenditure of money by a school district is necessary to respond to a disaster, including a tornado, hurricane, flood, wildfire, or other calamity, but not including a drought, epidemic, or pandemic, that has impacted the school district and the governor has requested federal disaster assistance for the area in which the school district is located, an election is not required under Section 
26.08
 to approve the tax rate adopted by the governing body of the school district for the year following the year in which the disaster occurs.  A tax rate adopted under this subsection applies only in the year for which the rate is adopted.
(f)  If a taxing unit adopts a tax rate under Subsection (d) or (e), the amount by which that rate exceeds the taxing unit's voter-approval tax rate for that tax year may not be considered when calculating the taxing unit's voter-approval tax rate for the tax year following the year in which the taxing unit adopts the rate.
(g)  A taxing unit that in a tax year elects to calculate the taxing unit's voter-approval tax rate under Subsection (a) or adopt a tax rate that exceeds the taxing unit's voter-approval tax rate for that tax year without holding an election under Subsection (d) or (e) must specify the disaster declaration that provides the basis for authorizing the taxing unit to calculate or adopt a tax rate under the applicable subsection.  A taxing unit that in a tax year specifies a disaster declaration as providing the basis for authorizing the taxing unit to calculate or adopt a tax rate under Subsection (a), (d), or (e) may not in a subsequent tax year specify the same disaster declaration as providing the basis for authorizing the taxing unit to calculate or adopt a tax rate under one of those subsections if in an intervening tax year the taxing unit specifies a different disaster declaration as the basis for authorizing the taxing unit to calculate or adopt a tax rate under one of those subsections.

Sec. 26.043.  VOTER-APPROVAL AND NO-NEW-REVENUE TAX RATES IN CITY IMPOSING MASS TRANSIT SALES AND USE TAX.  (a)  In the tax year in which a city has set an election on the question of whether to impose a local sales and use tax under Subchapter 
H
, Chapter 
453
, Transportation Code, the officer or employee designated to make the calculations provided by Section 
26.04
 may not make those calculations until the outcome of the election is determined.  If the election is determined in favor of the imposition of the tax, the designated officer or employee shall subtract from the city's voter-approval and no-new-revenue tax rates the amount that, if applied to the city's current total value, would impose an amount equal to the amount of property taxes budgeted in the current tax year to pay for expenses related to mass transit services.
(b)  In a tax year to which this section applies, a reference in this chapter to the city's no-new-revenue or voter-approval tax rate refers to that rate as adjusted under this section.
(c)  For the purposes of this section, "mass transit services" does not include the construction, reconstruction, or general maintenance of municipal streets.

(a)  The first time that a county adopts a tax rate after September 1, 1991, in which the state criminal justice mandate applies to the county, the no-new-revenue maintenance and operation rate for the county is increased by the rate calculated according to the following formula:
(State Criminal Justice Mandate) / (Current Total Value - New Property Value)
(b)  In the second and subsequent years that a county adopts a tax rate, if the amount spent by the county for the state criminal justice mandate increased over the previous year, the no-new-revenue maintenance and operation rate for the county is increased by the rate calculated according to the following formula:
(This Year's State Criminal Justice Mandate - Previous Year's State Criminal Justice Mandate) / (Current Total Value - New Property Value)
(c)  The county shall include a notice of the increase in the no-new-revenue maintenance and operation rate provided by this section, including a description and amount of the state criminal justice mandate, in the information published under Section 
26.04

Sec. 26.05.  TAX RATE.  (a)  The governing body of each taxing unit shall adopt a tax rate for the current tax year and shall notify the assessor for the taxing unit of the rate adopted.  The governing body must adopt a tax rate before the later of September 30 or the 60th day after the date the certified appraisal roll is received by the taxing unit, except that the governing body must adopt a tax rate that exceeds the voter-approval tax rate not later than the 71st day before the next uniform election date prescribed by Section 
41.001
, Election Code, that occurs in November of that year.  The tax rate consists of two components, each of which must be approved separately.  The components are:
(1)  for a taxing unit other than a school district, the rate that, if applied to the total taxable value, will impose the total amount described by Section 
26.04
(e)(3)(C), less any amount of additional sales and use tax revenue that will be used to pay debt service, or, for a school district, the rate calculated under Section 
44.004
(c)(5)(A)(ii)(b), Education Code; and
(2)  the rate that, if applied to the total taxable value, will impose the amount of taxes needed to fund maintenance and operation expenditures of the taxing unit for the next year.
(b)  A taxing unit may not impose property taxes in any year until the governing body has adopted a tax rate for that year, and the annual tax rate must be set by ordinance, resolution, or order, depending on the method prescribed by law for adoption of a law by the governing body. The vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order setting the tax rate must be separate from the vote adopting the budget.  For a taxing unit other than a school district, the vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax rate that exceeds the no-new-revenue tax rate must be a record vote, and at least 60 percent of the members of the governing body must vote in favor of the ordinance, resolution, or order.  For a school district, the vote on the ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax rate that exceeds the rate calculated as provided by Section 
44.004
(c)(5)(A)(ii), Education Code, must be a record vote, and at least 60 percent of the members of the governing body must vote in favor of the ordinance, resolution, or order.  A motion to adopt an ordinance, resolution, or order setting a tax rate that exceeds the no-new-revenue tax rate must be made in the following form: "I move that the property tax rate be increased by the adoption of a tax rate of (specify tax rate), which is effectively a (insert percentage by which the proposed tax rate exceeds the no-new-revenue tax rate) percent increase in the tax rate."  If the ordinance, resolution, or order sets a tax rate that, if applied to the total taxable value, will impose an amount of taxes to fund maintenance and operation expenditures of the taxing unit that exceeds the amount of taxes imposed for that purpose in the preceding year, the taxing unit must:
(1)  include in the ordinance, resolution, or order in type larger than the type used in any other portion of the document:
(A)  the following statement: "THIS TAX RATE WILL RAISE MORE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS THAN LAST YEAR'S TAX RATE."; and
(B)  if the tax rate exceeds the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate, the following statement: "THE TAX RATE WILL EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY (INSERT PERCENTAGE BY WHICH THE TAX RATE EXCEEDS THE NO-NEW-REVENUE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE) PERCENT AND WILL RAISE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ON A $100,000 HOME BY APPROXIMATELY $(Insert amount)."; and
(2)  include on the home page of the Internet website of the taxing unit:
(A)  the following statement: "(Insert name of taxing unit) ADOPTED A TAX RATE THAT WILL RAISE MORE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS THAN LAST YEAR'S TAX RATE"; and
(B)  if the tax rate exceeds the no-new-revenue maintenance and operations rate, the following statement: "THE TAX RATE WILL EFFECTIVELY BE RAISED BY (INSERT PERCENTAGE BY WHICH THE TAX RATE EXCEEDS THE NO-NEW-REVENUE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS RATE) PERCENT AND WILL RAISE TAXES FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ON A $100,000 HOME BY APPROXIMATELY $(Insert amount)."
(c)  If the governing body of a taxing unit does not adopt a tax rate before the date required by Subsection (a), the tax rate for the taxing unit for that tax year is the lower of the no-new-revenue tax rate calculated for that tax year or the tax rate adopted by the taxing unit for the preceding tax year.  A tax rate established by this subsection is treated as an adopted tax rate.  Before the fifth day after the establishment of a tax rate by this subsection, the governing body of the taxing unit must ratify the applicable tax rate in the manner required by Subsection (b).
(d)  The governing body of a taxing unit other than a school district may not adopt a tax rate that exceeds the lower of the voter-approval tax rate or the no-new-revenue tax rate calculated as provided by this chapter until the governing body has held a public hearing on the proposed tax rate and has otherwise complied with Section 
26.06
 and Section 
26.065
.  The governing body of a taxing unit shall reduce a tax rate set by law or by vote of the electorate to the lower of the voter-approval tax rate or the no-new-revenue tax rate and may not adopt a higher rate unless it first complies with Section 
26.06
.
(d-1)  The governing body of a taxing unit other than a school district may not hold a public hearing on a proposed tax rate or a public meeting to adopt a tax rate until the fifth day after the date the chief appraiser of each appraisal district in which the taxing unit participates has:
(1)  posted the notice required by Section 
26.04
(e-2) or published or posted the notice required by Section 
26.04
(e-6); and
(2)  complied with Section 
26.17
(f).
(d-2)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the governing body of a taxing unit other than a school district may not adopt a tax rate until the chief appraiser of each appraisal district in which the taxing unit participates has complied with Subsection (d-1).
(e)  A person who owns taxable property is entitled to an injunction restraining the collection of taxes by a taxing unit in which the property is taxable if the taxing unit has not complied with the requirements of this section or Section 
26.04
.  It is a defense in an action for an injunction under this subsection that the failure to comply was in good faith.  An action to enjoin the collection of taxes must be filed not later than the 15th day after the date the taxing unit adopts a tax rate.  A property owner is not required to pay the taxes imposed by a taxing unit on the owner's property while an action filed by the property owner to enjoin the collection of taxes imposed by the taxing unit on the owner's property is pending.  If the property owner pays the taxes and subsequently prevails in the action, the property owner is entitled to a refund of the taxes paid, together with reasonable attorney's fees and court costs.  The property owner is not required to apply to the collector for the taxing unit to receive the refund.
(e-1)  The governing body of a taxing unit that imposes an additional sales and use tax may not adopt the component of the tax rate of the taxing unit described by Subsection (a)(1) of this section until the chief financial officer or the auditor for the taxing unit submits to the governing body of the taxing unit a written certification that the amount of additional sales and use tax revenue that will be used to pay debt service has been deducted from the total amount described by Section 
26.04
(e)(3)(C) as required by Subsection (a)(1) of this section.  The comptroller shall prescribe the form of the certification required by this subsection and the manner in which it is required to be submitted.
(f)  Except as required by the law under which an obligation was created, the governing body may not apply any tax revenues generated by the rate described in Subsection (a)(1) of this section for any purpose other than the retirement of debt.
(g)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the governing body of a school district that elects to adopt a tax rate before the adoption of a budget for the fiscal year that begins in the current tax year may adopt a tax rate for the current tax year before receipt of the certified appraisal roll for the school district if the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the school district participates has certified to the assessor for the school district an estimate of the taxable value of property in the school district as provided by Section 
26.01
(e).  If a school district adopts a tax rate under this subsection, the no-new-revenue tax rate and the voter-approval tax rate of the district shall be calculated based on the certified estimate of taxable value.

Sec. 26.085.  ELECTION TO LIMIT DEDICATION OF SCHOOL FUNDS TO JUNIOR COLLEGE.  (a)  If the percentage of the total tax levy of a school district dedicated by the governing body of the school district to a junior college district under Section 
45.105
(e), Education Code, exceeds the percentage of the total tax levy of the school district for the preceding year dedicated to the junior college district under that section, the qualified voters of the school district by petition may require that an election be held to determine whether to limit the percentage of the total tax levy dedicated to the junior college district to the same percentage as the percentage of the preceding year's total tax levy dedicated to the junior college district.
(b)  A petition is valid only if:
(1)  it states that it is intended to require an election on the question of limiting the amount of school district tax funds to be dedicated to the junior college district for the current year;
(2)  it is signed by a number of registered voters of the school district equal to at least 10 percent of the number of registered voters of the school district according to the most recent official list of registered voters;  and
(3)  it is submitted to the governing body on or before the 90th day after the date on which the governing body made the dedication to the junior college district.
(c)  Not later than the 20th day after the day a petition is submitted, the governing body shall determine whether the petition is valid and pass a resolution stating its finding.  If the governing body fails to act within the time allowed, the petition is treated as if it had been found valid.
(d)  If the governing body finds that the petition is valid (or fails to act within the time allowed), it shall order that an election be held in the school district on a date not less than 30 or more than 90 days after the last day on which it could have acted to approve or disapprove the petition.  A state law requiring local elections to be held on a specified date does not apply to the election unless a specified date falls within the time permitted by this section.  At the election, the ballots shall be prepared to permit voting for or against the proposition:  "Limiting the portion of the (name of school district) tax levy dedicated to the (name of junior college district) for the current year to the same portion that was dedicated last year."
(e)  If a majority of the qualified voters voting on the question in the election favor the proposition, the percentage of the total tax levy of the school district for the year to which the election applies dedicated to the junior college district is reduced to the same percentage of the total tax levy that was dedicated to the junior college district by the school district in the preceding year.  If the proposition is approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting in an election to limit the dedication to the junior college district in a year following a year in which there was no dedication of local tax funds to the junior college district under Section 
45.105
(e), Education Code, the school district may not dedicate any local tax funds to the junior college district in the year to which the election applies.  If the proposition is not approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting in the election, the percentage of the total tax levy dedicated to the junior college district is the percentage adopted by the governing body.

Sec. 26.09.  CALCULATION OF TAX.  (a)  On receipt of notice of the tax rate for the current tax year, the assessor for a taxing unit other than a county shall calculate the tax imposed on each property included on the appraisal roll for the unit.
(b)  The county assessor-collector shall add the properties and their values certified to him as provided by Chapter 
24
 of this code to the appraisal roll for county tax purposes.  The county assessor-collector shall use the appraisal roll certified to him as provided by Section 
26.01
 with the added properties and values to calculate county taxes.
(c)  The tax is calculated by:
(1)  subtracting from the appraised value of a property as shown on the appraisal roll for the unit the amount of any partial exemption allowed the property owner that applies to appraised value to determine net appraised value;
(2)  multiplying the net appraised value by the assessment ratio to determine assessed value;
(3)  subtracting from the assessed value the amount of any partial exemption allowed the property owner to determine taxable value;  and
(4)  multiplying the taxable value by the tax rate.
(c-1)  The assessor for a taxing unit shall calculate the amount of tax imposed by the taxing unit on property for the 2023 tax year as if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were in effect for that tax year and also as if the changes in law made by that Act were not in effect for that tax year.  This subsection expires December 31, 2024.
(d)  If a property is subject to taxation for a prior year in which it escaped taxation, the assessor shall calculate the tax for each year separately.  In calculating the tax, the assessor shall use the assessment ratio and tax rate in effect in the unit for the year for which back taxes are being imposed.  Except as provided by Subsection (d-1), the amount of back taxes due incurs interest calculated at the rate provided by Section 
33.01
(c) from the date the tax would have become delinquent had the tax been imposed in the proper tax year.
(d-1)  For purposes of this subsection, an appraisal district has constructive notice of the presence of an improvement if a building permit for the improvement has been issued by an appropriate governmental entity.  Back taxes assessed under Subsection (d) on an improvement to real property do not incur interest if:
(1)  the land on which the improvement is located did not escape taxation in the year in which the improvement escaped taxation;

Sec. 26.10.  PRORATING TAXES--LOSS OF EXEMPTION.  (a)  If the appraisal roll shows that a property is eligible for taxation for only part of a year because an exemption, other than a residence homestead exemption or an exemption described by Subsection (d), applicable on January 1 of that year terminated during the year, the tax due against the property is calculated by multiplying the tax due for the entire year as determined as provided by Section

(c)  If the appraisal roll shows that a residence homestead exemption under Section 
11.131
 applicable to a property on January 1 of a year terminated during the year, the tax due against the residence homestead is calculated by multiplying the amount of the taxes that otherwise would be imposed on the residence homestead for the entire year had the individual not qualified for the exemption under Section

(d-2)  This subsection and Subsections (d-3) and (d-4) apply only to taxes imposed by a taxing unit on property for the 2023 tax year and only if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, would lower the taxes imposed by the taxing unit on the property for that tax year.  The assessor for the taxing unit shall compute the amount of taxes imposed and the other information required by this section as if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were in effect for that tax year.  The tax bill or the separate statement must indicate that the bill is a provisional tax bill and include a statement in substantially the following form:
"If the Texas Legislature had not enacted property tax relief legislation during the 2023 legislative session, your tax bill would have been $____ (insert amount of tax bill if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were not in effect for that tax year).  Because of action by the Texas Legislature, your tax bill has been lowered by $____ (insert difference between amount of tax bill if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were not in effect for that tax year and amount of tax bill if that Act were in effect for that tax year), resulting in a lower tax bill of $____ (insert amount of tax bill if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were in effect for that tax year), contingent on the approval by the voters at an election to be held November 7, 2023, of the constitutional amendment proposed by H.J.R. 2, 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023.  If that constitutional amendment is not approved by the voters at the election, a supplemental tax bill in the amount of $____ (insert difference between amount of tax bill if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were not in effect for that tax year and amount of tax bill if that Act were in effect for that tax year) will be mailed to you."
(d-3)  A tax bill prepared by the assessor for a taxing unit as provided by Subsection (d-2) and mailed as provided by Subsection (a) is considered to be a provisional tax bill until the canvass of the votes on the constitutional amendment proposed by H.J.R. 2, 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023.  If the constitutional amendment is approved by the voters, the tax bill is considered to be a final tax bill for the taxes imposed on the property for the 2023 tax year, and no additional tax bill is required to be mailed unless another provision of this title requires the mailing of a corrected tax bill.  If the constitutional amendment is not approved by the voters:
(1)  a tax bill prepared by the assessor as provided by Subsection (d-2) is considered to be a final tax bill but only as to the portion of the taxes imposed on the property for the 2023 tax year that are included in the bill;
(2)  the amount of taxes imposed by each taxing unit on property for the 2023 tax year is calculated as if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were not in effect for that tax year; and
(3)  except as provided by Subsections (f), (i-1), and (k), the assessor for each taxing unit shall prepare and mail a supplemental tax bill, by December 1 or as soon thereafter as practicable, in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the tax bill if the changes in law made by S.B. 2, Acts of the 88th Legislature, 2nd Called Session, 2023, were not in effect for that tax year and the amount of the tax bill if that Act were in effect for that tax year.
(d-4)  Except as otherwise provided by Subsection (d-3), the provisions of this section other than Subsection (d-2) apply to a supplemental tax bill mailed under Subsection (d-3).
(d-5)  This subsection and Subsections (d-2), (d-3), and (d-4) expire December 31, 2024.
(e)  An assessor may include taxes for more than one taxing unit in the same tax bill, but he shall include the information required by Subsection (c) of this section for the tax imposed by each unit included in the bill.
(f)  A collector may provide that a tax bill not be sent until the total amount of unpaid taxes the collector collects on the property for all taxing units the collector serves is $15 or more.  A collector may not send a tax bill for an amount of taxes less than $15 if before the tax bill is prepared the property owner files a written request with the collector that a tax bill not be sent until the total amount of unpaid taxes the collector collects on the property is $15 or more.  The request applies to all subsequent taxes the collector collects on the property until the property owner in writing revokes the request or the person no longer owns the property. 
(g)  Except as provided by Subsection (f), failure to send or receive the tax bill required by this section, including a tax bill that has been requested to be sent by electronic means under Subsection (k), does not affect the validity of the tax, penalty, or interest, the due date, the existence of a tax lien, or any procedure instituted to collect a tax.
(h)  An assessor who assesses taxes for more than one taxing unit may prepare and deliver separate bills for the taxes of a taxing unit that does not adopt a tax rate for the year before the 60th day after the date the chief appraiser certifies the appraisal roll for the unit under Section 
26.01
 of this code or, if the taxing unit participates in more than one appraisal district, before the 60th day after the date it receives a certified appraisal roll from any of the appraisal districts in which it participates.  If separate tax bills are prepared and delivered under this subsection, the taxing unit or taxing units that failed to adopt the tax rate before the prescribed deadline must pay the additional costs incurred in preparing and mailing the separate bills in addition to any other compensation required or agreed to be paid for the appraisal services rendered.
(i)  For a city or town that imposes an additional sales and use tax under Section 
321.101
(b) of this code, or a county that imposes a sales and use tax under Chapter 
323
 of this code, the tax bill shall indicate the amount of additional ad valorem taxes, if any, that would have been imposed on the property if additional ad valorem taxes had been imposed in an amount equal to the amount of revenue estimated to be collected from the additional city sales and use tax or from the county sales and use tax, as applicable, for the year determined as provided by Section 
26.041
 of this code.
(i-1)  If an assessor mails a tax bill under Subsection (a) or delivers a tax bill by electronic means under Subsection (k) to a mortgagee of a property, the assessor is not required to mail or deliver by electronic means a copy of the bill to any mortgagor under the mortgage or to the mortgagor's authorized agent.
(j)  If a tax bill is mailed under Subsection (a) or delivered by electronic means under Subsection (k) to a mortgagee of a property, the mortgagee shall mail a copy of the bill to the owner of the property not more than 30 days following the mortgagee's receipt of the bill.
(k)  The assessor for a taxing unit shall deliver a tax bill as required by this section by electronic means if on or before September 15 the individual or entity entitled to receive a tax bill under this section and the assessor enter into an agreement for delivery of a tax bill by electronic means. An assessor who delivers a tax bill electronically under this subsection is not required to mail the same bill under Subsection (a).  An agreement entered into under this subsection:
(1)  must:
(A)  be in writing or in an electronic format;
(B)  be signed by the assessor and the individual or entity entitled to receive the tax bill under this section;
(C)  be in a format acceptable to the assessor;
(D)  specify the electronic means by which the tax bill is to be delivered; and

(2)  remains in effect for all subsequent tax bills until revoked by an authorized individual in a written revocation filed with the assessor.
(l)  The comptroller may:
(1)  prescribe acceptable media, formats, content, and methods for the delivery of tax bills by electronic means under Subsection (k); and
(2)  provide a model form agreement.

Sec. 31.06.  MEDIUM OF PAYMENT.
(a)  Except as provided by Section 
31.061

(b)  Acceptance by a collector of a check or money order or of payment by credit card constitutes payment of a tax as of the date of acceptance if the check, money order, or credit card invoice is duly paid or honored.  If the check, money order, or credit card invoice is not duly paid or honored, the collector shall deliver written notice of nonpayment to the person who attempted payment by check, money order, or credit card.  Until payment is made in full by cash or by a check, money order, or credit card that is duly paid or honored, the lien securing payment of the tax remains in effect, whether or not the person receives notice of nonpayment.
(c)  If a tax is paid by credit card, the collector may collect a fee for processing the payment.  The collector shall set the fee in an amount that is reasonably related to the expense incurred by the collector or taxing unit in processing the payment by credit card, not to exceed five percent of the amount of taxes and any penalties or interest being paid.  The fee is in addition to the amount of taxes, penalties, or interest.
(d)  If a check or money order accepted in payment of taxes or the invoice for a payment of taxes by credit card is not duly paid or honored, the amount of any charge against the taxing unit for processing the check, order, or credit card invoice is added to the amount of tax due in the same manner as penalties and interest are added for taxes that are delinquent.  The tax lien on the property also secures payment of the amount of the charge.
(e)  A collector may adopt a written policy that requires payment of delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, and costs and expenses recoverable under Section 
33.48
 only with United States currency, a cashier's check, a certified check, or an electronic funds transfer if the payment relates to:
(1)  personal property seized under Subchapter

Sec. 31.061.  PAYMENT OF TAXES ASSESSED AGAINST REAL PROPERTY BY CONVEYANCE TO TAXING UNIT OF PROPERTY.  (a)  An owner of real property may, subject to the approval of the governing body of all of the taxing units, by deed convey the property to the taxing unit that is owed the largest amount of the taxes, penalties, and interest assessed against the property in payment of the taxes, including delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest assessed against the property by each taxing unit.  The taxing unit acquiring the property holds title to the property on behalf of each taxing unit.  The lien of each taxing unit on the property conveyed is extinguished at the time of the conveyance.  The taxing unit acquiring the property may, subject to the approval of the governing body of another taxing unit, by deed convey the property to that taxing unit.  The taxing unit acquiring the property holds title to the property on behalf of each taxing unit.
(b)  A taxing unit acquiring property under this section may sell the property.  The sale may be conducted in a manner provided by Section 
34.05
.  If the taxing unit sells the property within six months after the date the owner conveys the property, the taxing unit shall pay to each taxing unit its proportionate share of the sale proceeds according to each taxing unit's share of the total amount of the taxes, penalties, and interest owed at the time of the acquisition.
(c)  A taxing unit that does not sell property acquired under this section within six months after the date the owner conveys the property shall pay to each taxing unit its proportionate share, as determined under Subsection (b), of the appraised market value of the property as shown on the most recent tax roll, less the value of all encumbrances burdening the property.  On making the payment provided by this subsection, the taxing unit owns the property outright and not on behalf of each taxing unit.  The period during which a taxing unit may hold title to the property on behalf of each taxing unit may be extended subject to the approval of the governing body of each taxing unit.
(d)  The collector shall credit against the taxes, penalties, and interest owed each taxing unit:
(1)  the taxing unit's share, as determined under Subsection (b), of the sale price if the property is sold within six months after the date the owner conveys the property;  or
(2)  the taxing unit's share, as determined under Subsection (b), of the appraised market value of the property as shown on the most recent tax roll, less the value of all encumbrances burdening the property, if the property is not sold within six months after the date the owner conveys the property.
(e)  The owner remains personally liable to each taxing unit to the extent the amount of the taxes, penalties, and interest owed each taxing unit exceeds the amount credited under Subsection (d).  The owner is entitled to a refund from each taxing unit to the extent the amount credited under Subsection (d) exceeds the amount of the taxes, penalties, and interest owed the taxing unit.
(f)  A conveyance of property to a taxing unit under this section is voidable by the taxing unit at any time that the taxing unit owns the property and determines that the condition of the property on the date the owner conveyed it was or may have been in violation of a federal or state law, regulation, rule, or order.  If the taxing unit voids the conveyance:
(1)  the taxing unit shall execute a quitclaim deed of the property to the owner, file the deed in the county records, and give notice of the deed and its filing to the owner;
(2)  the collector shall remove the credit against the taxes, penalties, and interest owed each taxing unit made under this section;
(3)  a taxing unit that does not acquire the property shall refund the payment made to it by the taxing unit that acquires the property and reinstate the taxes, penalties, and interest owed the taxing unit;  and
(4)  the lien of each taxing unit is reinstated as of the date it originally attached.

Sec. 31.07.  CERTAIN PAYMENTS ACCEPTED.  (a)  A person may pay the tax imposed on any one property without simultaneously paying taxes imposed on other property he owns.
(b)  A collector shall accept payment of the tax imposed on a property by a taxing unit that has adopted the discounts under Section 
31.05
 of this code separately from taxes imposed on that property by other taxing units using the same collector, even if the taxes are included in the same bill.  The collector may adopt a policy of accepting separate payments in other circumstances.  If the tax paid is included in the same bill as other taxes that are not paid, the collector shall send a revised bill or receipt to reflect the tax payment, if a discount applies to the payment, and may send a revised bill or receipt to reflect the tax payment in other circumstances.  The sending of a revised bill does not affect the date on which the unpaid taxes become delinquent.
(c)  A collector may adopt a policy of accepting partial payments of property taxes.  A payment option provided by Section 
31.03
 of this code or a discount adopted under Section 
31.05
 of this code does not apply to any portion of a partial payment.  If a collector accepts a partial payment on a tax bill that includes taxes for more than one taxing unit, the collector shall allocate the partial payment among all the taxing units included in the bill in proportion to the amount of tax included in the bill for each taxing unit, unless the collector under Subsection (b) has adopted a policy of accepting payments of a taxing unit's taxes separate from the taxes of other taxing units included in the same bill and the taxpayer directs that the partial payment be allocated in specific amounts to one or more specific taxing units. Acceptance of a partial payment does not affect the date that the tax becomes delinquent, but the penalties and interest provided by Section 
33.01
 of this code are incurred only by the portion of a tax that remains unpaid on the date the tax becomes delinquent.
(d)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c), a collector shall accept a partial payment of property taxes on a tax bill that includes taxes for more than one taxing unit if one or more of the taxing units has adopted the discounts under Section 
31.05
 of this code, the taxpayer directs that the partial payment be allocated first to the payment of the taxes owed one or more of the taxing units that have adopted the discounts, and the amount of the payment is equal to or greater than the amount of the taxes owed the taxing units designated by the taxpayer.

Sec. 31.071.  CONDITIONAL PAYMENTS.  (a)  The collector of a taxing unit shall accept conditional payments of taxes before the delinquency date for property taxes that are subject to a pending challenge or protest.
(b)  A property owner whose property is subject to a pending protest or challenge may pay the tax due on the amount of value of the property involved in the pending action that is not in dispute or the amount of tax paid on the property in the preceding year, whichever is greater, but not to exceed the amount of tax that would be due on the appraised value that is subject to protest or challenge.  The collector of the taxing unit shall provide the property owner with a temporary receipt of taxes paid under this section.
(c)  If the property is no longer subject to a challenge, protest, or appeal at any time before the delinquency date, the collector shall apply the amount paid by the property owner under this section to the tax imposed on the property and shall refund the remainder, if any, to the property owner.  If the property is still subject to an appeal on the last working day before the delinquency date, or at an earlier date if so requested by the property owner, the collector shall apply the amount paid under this section to the payment required by Section 
42.08
(b) of this code and shall retain the remainder, if any, until the appeal is completed.  When the appeal is completed, the collector shall apply any amount retained under this section to the tax ultimately imposed on the property that is not covered by the payment under Section 
42.08
(b) and shall refund the remainder, if any, to the property owner.

Sec. 31.072.  ESCROW ACCOUNTS.  (a)  The collector for a taxing unit may enter a contract with a property owner under which the property owner deposits money in an escrow account maintained by the collector to provide for the payment of property taxes collected by the collector on any property the person owns.
(b)  A contract may not be made before October 1 of the year preceding the tax year for which the account is established.  The collector may agree to establish a combined account for more than one item of property having the same owner on the property owner's request.  If a collector collects taxes for more than one taxing unit, an account must apply to taxes on the affected property for each of the taxing units.
(c)  A contract under this section must require the property owner to make monthly deposits to the escrow account until the amount set in the contract under Subsection (d) of this section accrues in the account or until the tax bill for the property is prepared, whichever occurs earlier.
(d)  On request by a property owner to establish an escrow account under this section, the collector shall estimate the amount of taxes to be imposed on the property by the affected taxing units in that year.  A contract to establish an escrow account must provide for deposits that would provide, as of the date the collector estimates the tax bill for the property will be prepared, a total deposit that is not less than the amount of taxes estimated by the collector or the amount of taxes imposed on the property by the affected taxing units in the preceding year, whichever is less.  The collector may agree to a deposit of a greater amount on the property owner's request.
(e)  The county tax assessor-collector shall maintain the escrow account in the county depository.  Any other collector shall maintain the escrow account in the depository of the taxing unit or other entity that employs the collector.  The collector is not required to maintain a separate account in the depository for each escrow account but shall maintain separate records for each escrow account.
(f)  The property owner may withdraw from the collector the money the owner deposited in an escrow account only if the withdrawal is made before the date the tax bill is prepared or October 1 of the tax year, whichever occurs earlier.  On and after that date and until the taxes are paid, the collector must agree to a withdrawal by the taxpayer.  The property owner may not withdraw less than the total amount deposited in the escrow account.
(g)  When the tax bill is prepared for property for which an escrow account is established, the collector shall apply the money in the account to the taxes imposed and deliver a tax receipt to the taxpayer together with a refund of any amount in the account in excess of the amount of taxes paid.  If the amount in the escrow account is not sufficient to pay the taxes in full, the collector shall apply the money to the taxes and deliver to the taxpayer a tax receipt for the partial payment and a tax bill for the unpaid amount.  If the escrow account applies to more than one taxing unit or to more than one item of property, the collector shall apply the amount to each taxing unit or item of property in proportion to the amount of taxes imposed unless the contract provides otherwise.
(h)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), if the property owner requesting a collector to establish an escrow account under this section is a disabled veteran as defined by Section 
11.22
 or a recipient of the Purple Heart, the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Bronze Star Medal, the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, or a service cross awarded by a branch of the United States armed forces and the escrow account is to be used solely to provide for the payment of property taxes collected by the collector on the property owner's residence homestead, the collector shall enter into a contract with the property owner under this section.
(i)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), if the property owner requesting a collector to establish an escrow account under this section is the owner of a manufactured home and the escrow account is to be used solely to provide for the payment of property taxes collected by the collector on the property owner's manufactured home, the collector shall enter into a contract with the property owner under this section.

 due the unit on a property according to the unit's current tax records.  If the collector collects taxes for more than one taxing unit, the certificate must show the amount of delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, and any known costs and expenses under Section 
33.48

However, the collector may not make the refund unless:
(1)  in the case of a collector who collects taxes for one taxing unit, the governing body of the taxing unit also determines that the payment was erroneous or excessive and approves the refund if the amount of the refund exceeds:
(A)  $5,000 for a refund to be paid by a county with a population of 2.5 million or more; or
(B)  $500 for a refund to be paid by any other taxing unit; or

(1)  for which the refund is sought on January 1 of the tax year in which the taxes that were overpaid or erroneously paid were assessed; and
(2)  on which the taxes are delinquent on January 1 of the tax year for which the delinquent taxes were assessed.
(c)  Except as provided by Subsection (c-1), an application for a refund must be made within three years after the date of the payment or the taxpayer waives the right to the refund.  A taxpayer may apply for a refund by filing:
(1)  an application on a form prescribed by the comptroller by rule; or
(2)  a written request that includes information sufficient to enable the collector and the auditor for the taxing unit and, if applicable, the governing body of the taxing unit to determine whether the taxpayer is entitled to the refund.
(c-1)  The governing body of the taxing unit may extend the deadline provided by Subsection (c) for a single period not to exceed two years on a showing of good cause by the taxpayer.
(d)  The collector for a taxing unit shall provide a copy of the refund application form without charge on request of a taxpayer or a taxpayer's representative.

(1)  include an affirmation by the taxpayer that the information in the application is true and correct;  and
(2)  be signed by the taxpayer.
(f)  This subsection applies only to a refund that is required to be approved by the governing body of a taxing unit.  The presiding officer of the governing body of the taxing unit is not required to sign the application for the refund or any document accompanying the application to indicate the governing body's approval or disapproval of the refund.  The collector for the taxing unit shall indicate on the application whether the governing body approved or disapproved the refund and the date of the approval or disapproval.
(g)  If a taxpayer submits a payment of taxes that exceeds by $5 or more the amount of taxes owed for a tax year to a taxing unit, the collector for the taxing unit, without charge, shall mail to the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative a written notice of the amount of the overpayment accompanied by a refund application form.
(h)  This section does not apply to an overpayment caused by a change of exemption status or correction of a tax roll, including an overpayment received after a correction of a tax roll as a result of an appeal under Chapter 
42
.  Such an overpayment is covered by Section 
26.15
 or 
42.43
, as applicable.
(i)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, in the case of an overpayment or erroneous payment of taxes submitted by a taxpayer to a collector who collects taxes for one or more taxing units one of which is a county with a population of 2.5 million or more:
(1)  a taxpayer is not required to apply to the collector for the refund to be entitled to receive the refund if the amount of the refund is at least $5 but does not exceed $5,000; and
(2)  the collector is not required to comply with Subsection (g) unless the amount of the payment exceeds by more than $5,000 the amount of taxes owed for a tax year to a taxing unit for which the collector collects taxes.
(j)  If the collector for a taxing unit does not respond to an application for a refund on or before the 90th day after the date the application is filed with the collector, the application is presumed to have been denied.
(k)  Not later than the 60th day after the date the collector for a taxing unit denies an application for a refund, the taxpayer may file suit against the taxing unit in district court to compel the payment of the refund.  If the collector collects taxes for more than one taxing unit, the taxpayer shall join in the suit each taxing unit on behalf of which the collector denied the refund.  If the taxpayer prevails in the suit, the taxpayer may be awarded:
(1)  costs of court; and
(2)  reasonable attorney's fees in an amount not to exceed the greater of:
(A)  $1,500; or
(B)  30 percent of the total amount of the refund determined by the court to be due.

Sec. 32.03.  RESTRICTIONS ON PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX LIEN.  (a)  Except as provided by Subsection (a-1), a tax lien may not be enforced against personal property transferred to a buyer in ordinary course of business as defined by Section 
1.201
(9) of the Business & Commerce Code for value who does not have actual notice of the existence of the lien.
(a-1)  With regard to a manufactured home, a tax lien may be recorded at any time not later than six months after the end of the year for which the tax was owed.  A tax lien on a manufactured home may be enforced if it has been recorded in accordance with the laws in effect at the time of the recordation of the lien.  A properly recorded tax lien may not be enforced against a new manufactured home that is owned by a person who acquired the manufactured home from a retailer as a buyer in the ordinary course of business.
(a-2)  A person may not transfer ownership of a manufactured home until all tax liens perfected on the home that have been timely filed with the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs have been extinguished or satisfied and released and any personal property taxes on the manufactured home which accrued on each January 1 that falls within the 18 months preceding the date of the sale have been paid.  This subsection does not apply to the sale of a manufactured home in inventory.
(b)  A bona fide purchaser for value or the holder of a lien recorded on a manufactured home statement of ownership is not required to pay any taxes that have not been recorded with the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs.  In this section, manufactured home has the meaning assigned by Section 
32.015

(c)  A taxpayer may designate in writing which tax year will be credited with a particular payment.  If a taxpayer pays all the amounts owing for a given year, the taxing unit shall issue a receipt for the payment of the taxes for the designated year.
(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a manufactured home was omitted from the tax roll for either or both of the two preceding tax years, the taxing unit may file a tax lien within the 150-day period following the date on which the tax becomes delinquent.
(e)  If personal property taxes on a manufactured home have not been levied by the taxing unit, the taxing unit shall provide, upon request, an estimated amount of taxes computed by multiplying the taxable value of the manufactured home, according to the most recent certified appraisal roll for the taxing unit, by the taxing unit's adopted tax rate for the preceding tax year.  In order to enable the transfer of the manufactured home, the tax collector shall accept the payment of the estimated personal property taxes and issue a certification to the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs that the estimated taxes are being held in escrow until the taxes are levied.  Once the taxes are levied, the tax collector shall apply the escrowed sums to the levied taxes.  At the time the tax collector accepts the payment of the taxes, the tax collector shall provide notice that the payment of the estimated taxes is an estimate that may be raised once the appraisal rolls for the year are certified and that the new owner may be liable for the payment of any difference between the tax established by the certified appraisal roll and the estimate actually paid.

Sec. 32.04.  PRIORITIES AMONG TAX LIENS.  (a)  Whether or not a tax lien provided by this chapter takes priority over a tax lien of the United States is determined by federal law.

Sec. 32.05.  PRIORITY OF TAX LIENS OVER OTHER PROPERTY INTERESTS.  (a)  A tax lien on real property takes priority over a homestead interest in the property.
(b)  Except as provided by Subsection (c)(1), a tax lien provided by this chapter takes priority over:
(1)  the claim of any creditor of a person whose property is encumbered by the lien;
(2)  the claim of any holder of a lien on property encumbered by the tax lien, including any lien held by a property owners' association, homeowners' association, condominium unit owners' association, or council of owners of a condominium regime under a restrictive covenant, condominium declaration, master deed, or other similar instrument that secures regular or special maintenance assessments, fees, dues, interest, fines, costs, attorney's fees, or other monetary charges against the property; and
(3)  any right of remainder, right or possibility of reverter, or other future interest in, or encumbrance against, the property, whether vested or contingent.
(b-1)  The priority given to a tax lien by Subsection (b) prevails, regardless of whether the debt, lien, future interest, or other encumbrance existed before attachment of the tax lien.
(c)  A tax lien provided by this chapter is inferior to:
(1)  a claim for any survivor's allowance, funeral expenses, or expenses of the last illness of a decedent made against the estate of a decedent as provided by law;
(2)  except as provided by Subsection (b)(2), a recorded restrictive covenant that runs with the land  and was recorded before January 1 of the year the tax lien arose; or
(3)  a valid easement of record recorded before January 1 of the year the tax lien arose.
(d)  In an action brought under Chapter 
33
 for the enforced collection of a delinquent tax against property, a property owners' association, homeowners' association, condominium unit owners' association, or council of owners of a condominium regime that holds a lien for regular or special maintenance assessments, fees, dues, interest, fines, costs, attorney's fees, or other monetary charges against the property is not a necessary party to the action unless, at the time the action is commenced, notice of the lien in a liquidated amount is evidenced by a sworn instrument duly executed by an authorized person and recorded with the clerk of the county in which the property is located.   A tax sale of the property extinguishes the lien held by a property owners' association, homeowners' association, condominium unit owners' association, or council of owners of a condominium regime for all amounts that accrued before the date of sale if:
(1)  the holder of the lien is joined as a party to an action brought under Chapter 
33
 by virtue of a notice of the lien on record at the time the action is commenced; or
(2)  the notice of lien is not of record at the time the action is commenced, regardless of whether the holder of the lien is made a party to the action.
(e)  The existence of a recorded restrictive covenant, declaration, or master deed that generally provides for the lien held by a property owners' association, homeowners' association, condominium unit owners' association, or council of owners of a condominium regime does not, by itself, constitute actual or constructive notice to a taxing unit of a lien under Subsection (d).

If the lien transferred is on residential property owned and used by the property owner for personal, family, or household purposes, the additional interest may not exceed five cents for each $1 of a scheduled installment.
(f)  The holder of a loan secured by a transferred tax lien that is delinquent for 90 consecutive days must send a notice of the delinquency by certified mail on or before the 120th day of delinquency or, if the 120th day is not a business day, on the next business day after the 120th day of delinquency, to any holder of a recorded preexisting lien on the property.

(j)  After one year from the date on which a tax lien transferred under this section is recorded in all counties in which the property is located, the transferee of the lien may foreclose the lien in the manner provided by Subsection (c) unless the contract between the transferee and the owner of the property encumbered by the lien provides otherwise.  The proceeds of a sale following a judicial foreclosure as provided by this subsection shall be applied first to the payment of court costs, then to payment of the judgment, including accrued interest, and then to the payment of any attorney's fees fixed in the judgment.  Any remaining proceeds shall be paid to other holders of liens on the property in the order of their priority and then to the person whose property was sold at the tax sale.
(k)  Beginning on the date the foreclosure deed is recorded, the person whose property is sold as provided by Subsection (c) or the mortgage servicer of a prior recorded lien against the property is entitled to redeem the foreclosed property from the purchaser or the purchaser's successor by paying the purchaser or successor:
(1)  125 percent of the purchase price during the first year of the redemption period or 150 percent of the purchase price during the second year of the redemption period with cash or cash equivalent funds; and
(2)  the amount reasonably spent by the purchaser in connection with the property as costs within the meaning of Section 
34.21
(g) and the legal judgment rate of return on that amount.
(k-1)  The right of redemption provided by Subsection (k) may be exercised on or before the second anniversary of the date on which the purchaser's deed is filed of record if the property sold was the residence homestead of the owner, was land designated for agricultural use, or was a mineral interest.  For any other property, the right of redemption must be exercised not later than the 180th day after the date on which the purchaser's deed is filed of record.  If a person redeems the property as provided by Subsection (k) and this subsection, the purchaser at the tax sale or the purchaser's successor shall deliver a deed without warranty to the property to the person redeeming the property.  If the person who owned the property at the time of foreclosure redeems the property, all liens existing on the property at the time of the tax sale remain in effect to the extent not paid from the sale proceeds.
(l)  Except as specifically provided by this section, a property owner cannot waive or limit any requirement imposed on a transferee by this section.

(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, a transferee of a tax lien or the transferee's assignee is subrogated to and is entitled to exercise any right or remedy possessed by the transferring taxing unit, including or related to foreclosure or judicial sale, but is prohibited from exercising a remedy of foreclosure or judicial sale where the transferring taxing unit would be prohibited from foreclosure or judicial sale.

Sec. 32.07.  PERSONAL LIABILITY FOR TAX.

(e)  With respect to an ad valorem tax or other money subject to the provisions of Subsection (d), an individual who controls or supervises the collection of tax or money from another person, or an individual who controls or supervises the accounting for and paying over of the tax or money, and who wilfully fails to pay or cause to be paid the tax or money is liable as a responsible individual for an amount equal to the tax or money, plus all interest, penalties, and costs, not paid or caused to be paid.  The liability imposed by this subsection is in addition to any other penalty provided by law.  The dissolution of a corporation, association, limited liability company, or partnership does not affect a responsible individual's liability under this subsection.
(f)  Venue for suits arising under this section shall be governed by Section 
33.41
(a).
(g)  In this section:
(1)  "Responsible individual" includes an officer, manager, director, or employee or a corporation, association, or limited liability company or a member of a partnership who, as an officer, manager, director, employee, or member, is under a duty to perform an act with respect to the collection, accounting, or payment of a tax or money subject to the provisions of Subsection (d).

However, a tax delinquent on July 1 incurs a total penalty of twelve percent of the amount of the delinquent tax without regard to the number of months the tax has been delinquent.  A delinquent tax continues to incur the penalty provided by this subsection as long as the tax remains unpaid, regardless of whether a judgment for the delinquent tax has been rendered.
(b)  If a person who exercises the split-payment option provided by Section 
31.03
 of this code fails to make the second payment before July 1, the second payment is delinquent and incurs a penalty of twelve percent of the amount of unpaid tax.
(c)  A delinquent tax accrues interest at a rate of one percent for each month or portion of a month the tax remains unpaid.  Interest payable under this section is to compensate the taxing unit for revenue lost because of the delinquency.  A delinquent tax continues to accrue interest under this subsection as long as the tax remains unpaid, regardless of whether a judgment for the delinquent tax has been rendered.
(d)  In lieu of the penalty imposed under Subsection (a), a delinquent tax incurs a penalty of 50 percent of the amount of the tax without regard to the number of months the tax has been delinquent if the tax is delinquent because the property owner received an exemption under:
(1)  Section 
11.13
 and the chief appraiser subsequently cancels the exemption because the residence was not the principal residence of the property owner and the property owner received an exemption for two or more additional residence homesteads for the tax year in which the tax was imposed;
(2)  Section 
11.13
(c) or (d) for a person who is 65 years of age or older and the chief appraiser subsequently cancels the exemption because the property owner was younger than 65 years of age;  or
(3)  Section 
11.13
(q) and the chief appraiser subsequently cancels the exemption because the property owner was younger than 55 years of age when the property owner's spouse died.
(e)  A penalty imposed under Subsection (d) does not apply if:
(1)  the exemption was granted by the appraisal district or board and not at the request or application of the property owner or the property owner's agent;  or
(2)  at any time before the date the tax becomes delinquent, the property owner gives to the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the property is located written notice of circumstances that would disqualify the owner for the exemption.
(f)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, a delinquent tax for which a person defers payment under Section 
31.02
(b) that is not paid on or before the date the deferral period prescribed by that subsection expires:
(1)  accrues interest at a rate of six percent for each year or portion of a year the tax remains unpaid; and
(2)  does not incur a penalty.

(a-1)  An installment agreement under this section:
(1)  must be in writing;
(2)  must provide for payments to be made in monthly installments;

(b-1)  Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, a penalty does not accrue as provided by Section 
33.01

11.13
.  If the property owner fails to make a payment as required by the agreement, a penalty accrues as provided by Section 
33.01
(a) on the unpaid balance as if the owner had not entered into the agreement.
(c)  A property owner's execution of an installment agreement under this section is an irrevocable admission of liability for all taxes, penalties, and interest that are subject to the agreement.

Sec. 33.06.  DEFERRED COLLECTION OF TAXES ON RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD OF ELDERLY OR DISABLED PERSON OR DISABLED VETERAN.  (a)  An individual is entitled to defer collection of a tax, abate a suit to collect a delinquent tax, or abate a sale to foreclose a tax lien if:
(1)  the individual:
(A)  is 65 years of age or older;
(B)  is disabled as defined by Section 
11.13
(m); or
(C)  is qualified to receive an exemption under Section 
11.22
; and
(2)  the tax was imposed against property that the individual owns and occupies as a residence homestead.
(b)  To obtain a deferral, an individual must file with the chief appraiser for the appraisal district in which the property is located an affidavit stating the facts required to be established by Subsection (a). The chief appraiser shall notify each taxing unit participating in the district of the filing. After an affidavit is filed under this subsection, a taxing unit may not file suit to collect delinquent taxes on the property and the property may not be sold at a sale to foreclose the tax lien until the 181st day after the date the collector for the taxing unit delivers a notice of delinquency of the taxes following the date the individual no longer owns and occupies the property as a residence homestead.
(c)  To obtain an abatement of a pending suit, the individual must file in the court in which suit is pending an affidavit stating the facts required to be established by Subsection (a). If no controverting affidavit is filed by the taxing unit filing suit or if, after a hearing, the court finds the individual is entitled to the deferral, the court shall abate the suit until the 181st day after the date the collector for the taxing unit delivers a notice of delinquency of the taxes following the date the individual no longer owns and occupies the property as a residence homestead. The clerk of the court shall deliver a copy of the judgment abating the suit to the chief appraiser of each appraisal district that appraises the property.
(c-1)  To obtain an abatement of a pending sale to foreclose the tax lien, the individual must deliver an affidavit stating the facts required to be established by Subsection (a) to the chief appraiser of each appraisal district that appraises the property, the collector for the taxing unit that requested the order of sale or the attorney representing that taxing unit for the collection of delinquent taxes, and the officer charged with selling the property not later than the fifth day before the date of the sale. After an affidavit is delivered under this subsection, the property may not be sold at a tax sale until the 181st day after the date the collector for the taxing unit delivers a notice of delinquency of the taxes following the date the individual no longer owns and occupies the property as a residence homestead. If property is sold in violation of this section, the property owner may file a motion to set aside the sale under the same cause number and in the same court as a judgment reference in the order of sale. The motion must be filed during the applicable redemption period as set forth in Section 
34.21
(a) or, if the property is bid off to a taxing entity, on or before the 180th day following the date the taxing unit's deed is filed of record, whichever is later. This right is not transferable to a third party.
(d)  A tax lien remains on the property and interest continues to accrue during the period collection of taxes is deferred or abated under this section.  The annual interest rate during the deferral or abatement period is five percent instead of the rate provided by Section 
33.01
.  Interest and penalties that accrued or that were incurred or imposed under Section 
33.01
 or 
33.07
 before the date the individual files the deferral affidavit under Subsection (b) or the date the judgment abating the suit is entered, as applicable, are preserved.  A penalty under Section 
33.01
 is not incurred during a deferral or abatement period.  The additional penalty under Section 
33.07
 may be imposed and collected only if the taxes for which collection is deferred or abated remain delinquent on or after the 181st day after the date the deferral or abatement period expires.  A plea of limitation, laches, or want of prosecution does not apply against the taxing unit because of deferral or abatement of collection as provided by this section.
(e)  Each year the chief appraiser for each appraisal district shall publicize in a manner reasonably designed to notify all residents of the district or county of the provisions of this section and, specifically, the method by which eligible persons may obtain a deferral or abatement.
(f)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if an individual who qualifies for a deferral or abatement of collection of taxes on property as provided by this section dies, the deferral or abatement continues in effect until the 181st day after the date the collector for the taxing unit delivers a notice of delinquency of the taxes following the date the surviving spouse of the individual no longer owns and occupies the property as a residence homestead if:
(1)  the property was the residence homestead of the deceased spouse when the deceased spouse died;
(2)  the surviving spouse was 55 years of age or older when the deceased spouse died; and
(3)  the property was the residence homestead of the surviving spouse when the deceased spouse died.
(g)  If the ownership interest of an individual entitled to a deferral under this section is a life estate, a lien for the deferred tax attaches to the estate of the life tenant, and not to the remainder interest, if the owner of the remainder is an institution of higher education that has not consented to the deferral.  In this subsection, "institution of higher education" has the meaning assigned by Section 
61.003
, Education Code.  This subsection does not apply to a deferral for which the individual entitled to the deferral filed the affidavit required by Subsection (b) before September 1, 2011.
(h)  An heir property owner who qualifies heir property as the owner's residence homestead under Chapter 
11
 is considered the sole owner of the property for the purposes of this section.

Sec. 33.065.  DEFERRED COLLECTION OF TAXES ON APPRECIATING RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD.  (a)  An individual is entitled to defer or abate a suit to collect a delinquent tax imposed on the portion of the appraised value of property the individual owns and occupies as the individual's residence homestead that exceeds the sum of:
(1)  105 percent of the appraised value of the property for the preceding year;  and
(2)  the market value of all new improvements to the property.
(b)  An individual may not obtain a deferral or abatement under this section, and any deferral or abatement previously received expires, if the taxes on the portion of the appraised value of the property that does not exceed the amount provided by Subsection (a) are delinquent.
(c)  To obtain a deferral, an individual must file with the chief appraiser for the appraisal district in which the property is located an affidavit stating the facts required to be established by Subsection (a).  The chief appraiser shall notify each taxing unit participating in the district of the filing.  After an affidavit is filed under this subsection, a taxing unit may not file suit to collect delinquent taxes on the property for which collection is deferred until the individual no longer owns and occupies the property as a residence homestead.
(d)  To obtain an abatement, the individual must file in the court in which the delinquent tax suit is pending an affidavit stating the facts required to be established by Subsection (a).  If the taxing unit that filed the suit does not file a controverting affidavit or if, after a hearing, the court finds the individual is entitled to the deferral, the court shall abate the suit until the individual no longer owns and occupies the property as the individual's residence homestead.  The clerk of the court shall deliver a copy of the judgment abating the suit to the chief appraiser of each appraisal district that appraises the property.
(e)  A deferral or abatement under this section applies only to ad valorem taxes imposed beginning with the tax year following the first tax year the individual entitled to the deferral or abatement qualifies the property for an exemption under Section 
11.13
.  For purposes of this subsection, the owner of a residence homestead that is qualified for an exemption under Section 
11.13
 on January 1, 1998, is considered to have qualified the property for the first time in the 1997 tax year.
(f)  If the collection of delinquent taxes on the property was deferred in a prior tax year and the sum of the amounts described by Subsections (a)(1) and (2) exceeds the appraised value of the property for the current tax year, the amount of taxes the collection of which may be deferred is reduced by the amount calculated by multiplying the taxing unit's tax rate for the current year by the amount by which that sum exceeds the appraised value of the property.
(g)  A tax lien remains on the property and interest continues to accrue during the period collection of delinquent taxes is deferred or abated under this section.  The annual interest rate during the deferral or abatement period is eight percent instead of the rate provided by Section 
33.01
.  Interest and penalties that accrued or that were incurred or imposed under Section 
33.01
 or 
33.07
 before the date the individual files the deferral affidavit under Subsection (c) or the date the judgment abating the suit is entered, as applicable, are preserved.  A penalty is not incurred on the delinquent taxes for which collection is deferred or abated during a deferral or abatement period.  The additional penalty under Section 
33.07
 may be imposed and collected only if the delinquent taxes for which collection is deferred or abated remain delinquent on or after the 91st day after the date the deferral or abatement period expires.  A plea of limitation, laches, or want of prosecution does not apply against the taxing unit because of deferral or abatement of collection as provided by this section.
(h)  Each year the chief appraiser for each appraisal district shall publicize in a manner reasonably designed to notify all residents of the county for which the appraisal district is established of the provisions of this section and, specifically, the method by which an eligible person may obtain a deferral.
(i)  In this section:
(1)  "New improvement" means an improvement to a residence homestead that is made after the appraisal of the property for the preceding year and that increases the market value of the property.  The term does not include ordinary maintenance of an existing structure or the grounds or another feature of the property.
(2)  "Residence homestead" has the meaning assigned that term by Section 
11.13
.
(j)  An heir property owner who qualifies heir property as the owner's residence homestead under Chapter 
11
 is considered the sole owner of the property for the purposes of this section.

(f)  Before filing a petition under this section, or as soon afterwards as practicable, the taxing unit or its attorney shall determine the address of each owner of a property interest in the parcel for the purpose of providing notice of the pending petition.  If the title search, the taxing unit's tax records, and the appraisal district records do not disclose an address of a person with a property interest, consulting the following sources of information is to be considered a reasonable effort by the taxing unit or its attorney to determine the address of a person with a property interest in the parcel subject to foreclosure:
(1)  telephone directories, electronic or otherwise, that cover:
(A)  the area of any last known address for the person; and
(B)  the county in which the parcel is located;
(2)  voter registration records in the county in which the parcel is located; and
(3)  where applicable, assumed name records maintained by the county clerk of the county in which the parcel is located and corporate records maintained by the secretary of state.
(g)  Not later than the 45th day before the date on which a hearing on the merits on a taxing unit's petition is scheduled, the taxing unit or its attorney shall send a copy of the petition and a notice by certified mail to each person whose address is determined under Subsection (f), informing the person of the pending foreclosure action and the scheduled hearing.  A copy of each notice shall be filed with the clerk of the court together with an affidavit by the tax collector or by the taxing unit's attorney attesting to the fact and date of mailing of the notice.
(h)  In addition to the notice required by Subsection (g), the taxing unit shall provide notice by publication and by posting to all persons with a property interest in the parcel subject to foreclosure.  The notice shall be published in the English language once a week for two weeks in a newspaper that is published in the county in which the parcel is located and that has been in general circulation for at least one year immediately before the date of the first publication, with the first publication to be not less than the 45th day before the date on which the taxing unit's petition is scheduled to be heard.  When returned and filed in the trial court, an  affidavit of the editor or publisher of the newspaper attesting to the date of publication, together with a printed copy of the notice as published, is sufficient proof of publication under this subsection.  If a newspaper is not published in the county in which the parcel is located, publication in an otherwise  qualifying newspaper published in an adjoining county is sufficient.  The maximum fee for publishing the citation shall be the lowest published word or line rate of that newspaper for classified advertising.  The notice by posting shall be in the English language and given by posting a copy of the notice at the courthouse door of the county in which the foreclosure is pending not less than the 45th day before the date on which the taxing unit's petition is scheduled to be heard.  Proof of the posting of the notice shall be made by affidavit of the attorney for the taxing unit, or of the person posting it.  If the publication of the notice cannot be had for the maximum fee established in this subsection, and that fact is supported by the affidavit of the attorney for the taxing unit, the notice by posting under this subsection is sufficient.
(i)  The notice required by Subsections (g) and (h) must include:
(1)  a statement that foreclosure proceedings have been commenced and the date the petition was filed;
(2)  a legal description, tax account number, and, if known, a street address for the parcel in which the addressee owns a property interest;
(3)  the name of the person to whom the notice is addressed and the name of each other person who, according to the title search, has an interest in the parcel in which the addressee owns a property interest;
(4)  the date, time, and place of the scheduled hearing on the petition;
(5)  a statement that the recipient of the notice may lose whatever property interest the recipient owns in the parcel as a result of the hearing and any subsequent tax sale;
(6)  a statement explaining how a person may contest the taxing unit's petition as provided by Subsection (j) and that a person's interest in the parcel may be preserved by paying all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, attorney's fees, and court costs before the date of the scheduled hearing on the petition;
(7)  the name, address, and telephone number of the taxing unit and the taxing unit's attorney of record; and
(8)  the name of each other taxing unit that imposes taxes on the parcel, together with a notice that any taxing unit may intervene without further notice and set up its claims for delinquent taxes.
(j)  A person claiming a property interest in a parcel subject to foreclosure may contest a taxing unit's petition by filing with the clerk of the court a written response to the petition not later than the seventh day before the date scheduled for hearing on the petition and specifying in the response any affirmative defense of the person.  A copy of the response must be served on the taxing unit's attorney of record in the manner required by Rule 21a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.  The taxing unit is entitled on request to a continuance of the hearing if a written response filed to a notice of the hearing contains an affirmative defense or requests affirmative relief against the taxing unit.
(k)  Before entry of a judgment under this section, a taxing unit may remove a parcel erroneously included in the petition and may take a voluntary nonsuit as to one or more parcels of property without prejudicing its action against the remaining parcels.
(l)  If before the hearing on a taxing unit's petition the taxing unit discovers a deficiency in the provision of notice under this section, the taxing unit shall take reasonable steps in good faith to correct the deficiency before the hearing.  A notice provided by Subsections (g)-(i) is in lieu of citation issued and served under Rule 117a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.  Regardless of the manner in which notice under this section is given, an attorney ad litem may not be appointed for a person with an interest in a parcel with delinquent taxes, penalties, interest, and attorney's fees against the parcel in an amount that exceeds the parcel's appraised value.  To the extent of any additional conflict between this section and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, this section controls.  Except as otherwise provided by this section, a suit brought under this section is governed generally by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and by Subchapters C and D of this chapter.
(m)  A judgment in favor of a taxing unit under this section must be only for foreclosure of the tax lien against the parcel.  The judgment may not include a personal judgment against any person.
(n)  A person is considered to have been provided sufficient notice of foreclosure and opportunity to be heard for purposes of a proceeding under this section if the taxing unit follows the procedures required by this section for notice by certified mail or by publication and posting or if one or more of the following apply:
(1)  the person had constructive notice of the hearing on the merits by acquiring an interest in the parcel after the date of the filing of the taxing unit's petition;
(2)  the person appeared at the hearing on the taxing unit's petition or filed a responsive pleading or other communication with the clerk of the court before the date of the hearing; or
(3)  before the hearing on the taxing unit's petition, the person had actual notice of the hearing.

CHAPTER 34. TAX SALES AND REDEMPTION
SUBCHAPTER A. TAX SALES
Sec. 34.01.  SALE OF PROPERTY.  (a)  Real property seized under a tax warrant issued under Subchapter 
E
, Chapter 
33
, or ordered sold pursuant to foreclosure of a tax lien shall be sold by the officer charged with selling the property, unless otherwise directed by the taxing unit that requested the warrant or order of sale or by an authorized agent or attorney for that unit.  The sale shall be conducted in the manner similar property is sold under execution except as otherwise provided by this subtitle.
(a-1)  The commissioners court of a county by official action may authorize the officer charged with selling property under this section to conduct a public auction using online bidding and sale.  The commissioners court may adopt rules governing online auctions authorized under this subsection.  Rules adopted by the commissioners court under this subsection take effect on the 90th day after the date the rules are published in the real property records of the county.
(b)  On receipt of an order of sale of real property, the officer charged with selling the property shall endorse on the order the date and exact time when the officer received the order.  The endorsement is a levy on the property without necessity for going upon the ground.  The officer shall calculate the total amount due under the judgment, including all taxes, penalties, and interest, plus any other amount awarded by the judgment, court costs, and the costs of the sale.  The costs of a sale include the costs of advertising, an auctioneer's commission and fees, and deed recording fees anticipated to be paid in connection with the sale of the property.  To assist the officer in making the calculation, the collector of any taxing unit that is party to the judgment may provide the officer with a certified tax statement showing the amount of the taxes included in the judgment that remain due that taxing unit and all penalties, interest, and attorney's fees provided by the judgment as of the date of the proposed sale.  If a certified tax statement is provided to the officer, the officer shall rely on the amount included in the statement and is not responsible or liable for the accuracy of the applicable portion of the calculation.  A certified tax statement is not required to be sworn to and is sufficient if the tax collector or the collector's deputy signs the statement.
(c)  The officer charged with the sale shall give written notice of the sale in the manner prescribed by Rule 21a, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, or that rule's successor to each person who was a defendant to the judgment or that person's attorney.
(d)  An officer's failure to send the written notice of sale or a defendant's failure to receive that notice is insufficient by itself to invalidate:
(1)  the sale of the property;  or
(2)  the title conveyed by that sale.
(e)  A notice of sale under Subsection (c) must substantially comply with this subsection. The notice must include:
(1)  a statement of the authority under which the sale is to be made;
(2)  the date, time, and location of the sale;
(3)  a brief description of the property to be sold; and
(4)  the statement required by Section 
232.0315
, Local Government Code, if the real property subject to the sale is located in a county subject to Subchapter B, Chapter 232, of that code and is presumed to be for residential use under Section 232.022 of that code.
(f)  A notice of sale is not required to include field notes describing the property.  A description of the property is sufficient if the notice:
(1)  states the number of acres and identifies the original survey;
(2)  as to property located in a platted subdivision or addition, regardless of whether the subdivision or addition is recorded, states the name by which the land is generally known with reference to that subdivision or addition;  or
(3)  by reference adopts the description of the property contained in the judgment.
(g)  For publishing a notice of sale, a newspaper may charge a rate that does not exceed the greater of:
(1)  two cents per word;  or
(2)  an amount equal to the published word or line rate of that newspaper for the same class of advertising.
(h)  If there is not a newspaper published in the county of the sale, or a newspaper that will publish the notice of sale for the rate authorized by Subsection (g), the officer shall post the notice in writing in three public places in the county not later than the 20th day before the date of the sale.  One of the notices must be posted at the door of the county courthouse.
(i)  The owner of real property subject to sale may file with the officer charged with the sale a written request that the property be divided and that only as many portions be sold as necessary to pay the amount due against the property, as calculated under Subsection (b).  In the request the owner shall describe the desired portions and shall specify the order in which the portions should be sold.  The owner may not specify more than four portions or a portion that divides a building or other contiguous improvement.  The request must be delivered to the officer not later than the seventh day before the date of the sale.
(j)  If a bid sufficient to pay the lesser of the amount calculated under Subsection (b) or the adjudged value is not received, the taxing unit that requested the order of sale may terminate the sale.  If the taxing unit does not terminate the sale, the officer making the sale shall bid the property off to the taxing unit that requested the order of sale, unless otherwise agreed by each other taxing unit that is a party to the judgment, for the aggregate amount of the judgment against the property or for the market value of the property as specified in the judgment, whichever is less.  The duty of the officer conducting the sale to bid off the property to a taxing unit under this subsection is self-executing.  The actual attendance of a representative of the taxing unit at the sale is not a prerequisite to that duty.
(k)  The taxing unit to which the property is bid off takes title to the property for the use and benefit of itself and all other taxing units that established tax liens in the suit.  The taxing unit's title includes all the interest owned by the defendant, including the defendant's right to the use and possession of the property, subject only to the defendant's right of redemption.  Payments in satisfaction of the judgment and any costs or expenses of the sale may not be required of the purchasing taxing unit until the property is redeemed or resold by the purchasing taxing unit.
(l)  Notwithstanding that property is bid off to a taxing unit under this section, a taxing unit that established a tax lien in the suit may continue to enforce collection of any amount for which a former owner of the property is liable to the taxing unit, including any post-judgment taxes, penalties, and interest, in any other manner provided by law.
(m)  The officer making the sale shall prepare a deed to the purchaser of real property at the sale, to any other person whom the purchaser may specify, or to the taxing unit to which the property was bid off.  The taxing unit that requested the order of sale may elect to prepare a deed for execution by the officer.  If the taxing unit prepares the deed, the officer shall execute that deed.  An officer who executes a deed prepared by the taxing unit is not responsible or liable for any inconsistency, error, or other defect in the form of the deed.  As soon as practicable after a deed is executed by the officer, the officer shall either file the deed for recording with the county clerk or deliver the executed deed to the taxing unit that requested the order of sale, which shall file the deed for recording with the county clerk.  The county clerk shall file and record each deed filed under this subsection and after recording shall return the deed to the grantee.
(n)  The deed vests good and perfect title in the purchaser or the purchaser's assigns to the interest owned by the defendant in the property subject to the foreclosure, including the defendant's right to the use and possession of the property, subject only to the defendant's right of redemption, the terms of a recorded restrictive covenant running with the land that was recorded before January 1 of the year in which the tax lien on the property arose, a recorded lien that arose under that restrictive covenant that was not extinguished in the judgment foreclosing the tax lien, and each valid easement of record as of the date of the sale that was recorded before January 1 of the year the tax lien arose.  The deed may be impeached only for fraud.
(o)  If a bid sufficient to pay the amount specified by Subsection (p) is not received, the officer making the sale, with the consent of the collector who applied for the tax warrant, may offer property seized under Subchapter 
E
, Chapter 
33
, to a person described by Section 
11.181
 or 
11.20
 for less than that amount.  If the property is offered to a person described by Section 
11.181
 or 
11.20
, the officer making the sale shall reopen the bidding at the amount of that person's bid and bid off the property to the highest bidder.  Consent to the sale by the taxing units entitled to receive proceeds of the sale is not required.  The acceptance of a bid by the officer under this subsection is conclusive and binding on the question of its sufficiency.  An action to set aside the sale on the grounds that a bid is insufficient may not be sustained, except that a taxing unit that participates in distribution of proceeds of the sale may file an action before the first anniversary of the date of the sale to set aside the sale on the grounds of fraud or collusion between the officer making the sale and the purchaser.
(p)  Except as provided by Subsection (o), property seized under Subchapter 
E
, Chapter 
33
, may not be sold for an amount that is less than the lesser of the market value of the property as specified in the warrant or the total amount of taxes, penalties, interest, costs, auctioneer's commission and fees, and other claims for which the warrant was issued.  If a sufficient bid is not received by the officer making the sale, the officer shall bid off the property to a taxing unit in the manner specified by Subsection (j) and subject to the other provisions of that subsection.  A taxing unit that takes title to property under this subsection takes title for the use and benefit of that taxing unit and all other taxing units that established tax liens in the suit or that, on the date of the seizure, were owed delinquent taxes on the property.
(q)  A sale of property under this section to a purchaser other than a taxing unit:
(1)  extinguishes each lien securing payment of the delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest against that property and included in the judgment;  and
(2)  does not affect the personal liability of any person for those taxes, penalties, and interest included in the judgment that are not satisfied from the proceeds of the sale.
(r)  Except as provided by Subsection (a-1) and this subsection, a sale of real property under this section must take place at the county courthouse in the county in which the land is located.  The commissioners court of the county may designate an area other than an area at the county courthouse where sales under this section will take place that is in a public place within a reasonable proximity of the county courthouse as determined by the commissioners court and in a location as accessible to the public as the courthouse door.  The commissioners court shall record that designation in the real property records of the county.  A designation by a commissioners court under this section is not a ground for challenging or invalidating any sale.  A sale must be held at an area designated under this subsection if the sale is held on or after the 90th day after the date the designation is recorded.
(r-1)  A sale of real property under this section, other than a sale conducted by means of a public auction using online bidding and sale under Subsection (a-1), must take place between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. on the first Tuesday of a month or, if the first Tuesday of a month occurs on January 1 or July 4, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. on the first Wednesday of the month.
(r-2)  A sale of real property conducted by means of a public auction using online bidding and sale under Subsection (a-1) may begin at any time and must conclude at 4 p.m. on the first Tuesday of a month or, if the first Tuesday of a month occurs on January 1 or July 4, at 4 p.m. on the first Wednesday of the month.
(s)  To the extent of a conflict between this section and a provision of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure that relates to an execution, this section controls.

(1)  there are no delinquent ad valorem taxes owed by the person to that county;  and
(2)  for each school district or municipality having territory in the county there are no known or reported delinquent ad valorem taxes owed by the person to that school district or municipality.

34.03
;

(H)  that the assignor or transferor knows that the assignor or transferor may retain counsel; and
(I)  that the consideration was paid in full on the date of the assignment or transfer and that the consideration paid was an amount equal to at least 80 percent of the amount of the assignor's or transferor's claim to the excess proceeds.
(g)  An assignee or transferee who obtains excess proceeds without complying with Subsection (f) is liable to the assignor or transferor for the amount of excess proceeds obtained plus attorney's fees and expenses.  An assignee or transferee who attempts to obtain excess proceeds without complying with Subsection (f) is liable to the assignor or transferor for attorney's fees and expenses.
(h)  An assignee or transferee who files a petition setting forth a claim to excess proceeds must attach a copy of the assignment or transfer document and produce the original of the assignment or transfer document in court at the hearing on the petition.  If the original assignment or transfer document is lost, the assignee or transferee must obtain the presence of the assignor or transferor to testify at the hearing.  In addition, the assignee or transferee must produce at the hearing the original of any evidence verifying the payment of the consideration given for the assignment or transfer.  If the original of any evidence of the payment is lost or if the payment was in cash, the assignee or transferee must obtain the presence of the assignor or transferor to testify at the hearing.
(i)  A fee charged by an attorney to obtain excess proceeds for an owner may not be greater than 25 percent of the amount obtained or $1,000, whichever is less.  A person who is not an attorney may not charge a fee to obtain excess proceeds for an owner.
(j)  The amount of the excess proceeds the court may order be paid to an assignee or transferee may not exceed 125 percent of the amount the assignee or transferee paid the assignor or transferor on the date of the assignment or transfer.

Sec. 34.05.  RESALE BY TAXING UNIT.  (a)  If property is sold to a taxing unit that is a party to the judgment, the taxing unit may sell the property at any time by public or private sale.  In selling the property, the taxing unit may, but is not required to, use the procedures provided by Section 
263.001
, Local Government Code, or Section 
272.001
, Local Government Code.  The sale is subject to any right of redemption of the former owner.  The redemption period begins on the date the deed to the taxing unit is filed for record.
(b)  Property sold pursuant to Subsections (c) and (d) of this section may be sold for any amount. This subsection does not authorize a sale of property in violation of Section 
52
, Article III, Texas Constitution.
(c)  The taxing unit purchasing the property by resolution of its governing body may request the sheriff or a constable to sell the property at a public sale.  If the purchasing taxing unit has not sold the property within six months after the date on which the owner's right of redemption terminates, any taxing unit that is entitled to receive proceeds of the sale by resolution of its governing body may request the sheriff or a constable in writing to sell the property at a public sale.  On receipt of a request made under this subsection, the sheriff or constable shall sell the property as provided by Subsection (d), unless the property is sold under Subsection (h) or (i) before the date set for the public sale.
(d)  Except as provided by this subsection, all public sales requested as provided by Subsection (c) must be conducted in the manner prescribed by the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for the sale of property under execution or, if directed by the commissioners court of the county, in accordance with Section 
34.01
(a-1) and the rules adopted under that section providing for public auction using online bidding and sale. The notice of the sale must contain a description of the property to be sold, the number and style of the suit under which the property was sold at the tax foreclosure sale, and the date of the tax foreclosure sale. The description of the property in the notice is sufficient if it is stated in the manner provided by Section 
34.01
(f). If the commissioners court of a county by order specifies the date or time at which or location in the county where a public sale requested under Subsection (c) shall be conducted, the sale shall be conducted on the date and at the time and location specified in the order. The acceptance of a bid by the officer conducting the sale is conclusive and binding on the question of its sufficiency. An action to set aside the sale on the grounds that the bid is insufficient may not be sustained in court, except that a taxing unit that participates in distribution of proceeds of the sale may file an action before the first anniversary of the date of the sale to set aside the sale on the grounds of fraud or collusion between the officer making the sale and the purchaser. On conclusion of the sale, the officer making the sale shall prepare a deed to the purchaser. The taxing unit that requested the sale may elect to prepare a deed for execution by the officer. If the taxing unit prepares the deed, the officer shall execute that deed. An officer who executes a deed prepared by the taxing unit is not responsible or liable for any inconsistency, error, or other defect in the form of the deed. As soon as practicable after a deed is executed by the officer, the officer shall either file the deed for recording with the county clerk or deliver the executed deed to the taxing unit that requested the sale, which shall file the deed for recording with the county clerk. The county clerk shall file and record each deed under this subsection and after recording shall return the deed to the grantee.
(e)  The presiding officer of a taxing unit selling real property under Subsection (h) or (i), under Section 
34.051
, or under Section 
253.010
, Local Government Code, or the sheriff or constable selling real property under Subsections (c) and (d) shall execute a deed to the property conveying to the purchaser the right, title, and interest acquired or held by each taxing unit that was a party to the judgment foreclosing tax liens on the property.  The conveyance shall be made subject to any remaining right of redemption at the time of the sale.
(f)  An action attacking the validity of a resale of property pursuant to this section may not be instituted after the expiration of one year after the date of the resale.
(g)  A taxing unit to which property is bid off may recover its costs of upkeep, maintenance, and environmental cleanup from the resale proceeds without further court order.
(h)  In lieu of a sale pursuant to Subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the taxing unit that purchased the property may sell the property at a private sale.  Consent of each taxing unit entitled to receive proceeds of the sale under the judgment is not required.  Property sold under this subsection may not be sold for an amount that is less than the lesser of:
(1)  the market value specified in the judgment of foreclosure;  or
(2)  the total amount of the judgments against the property.
(i)  In lieu of a sale pursuant to Subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the taxing unit that purchased the property may sell the property at a private sale for an amount less than required under Subsection (h) of this section with the consent of each taxing unit entitled to receive proceeds of the sale under the judgment.  This subsection does not authorize a sale of property in violation of Section 
52
, Article III, Texas Constitution.
(j)  In lieu of a sale pursuant to Subsections (c) and (d), the taxing unit that purchased the property may sell the property at a private sale for an amount equal to or greater than its market value, as shown by the most recent certified appraisal roll, if:
(1)  the sum of the amount of the judgment plus post-judgment taxes, penalties, and interest owing against the property exceeds the market value; and
(2)  each taxing unit entitled to receive proceeds of the sale consents to the sale for that amount.
(k)  A sale under Subsection (j) discharges and extinguishes all liens foreclosed by the judgment and, with the exception of the prorated tax for the current year that is assessed under Section 
26.10
, the liens for post-judgment taxes that accrued from the date of judgment until the date the taxing unit purchased the property. The presiding officer of a taxing unit selling real property under Subsection (j) shall execute a deed to the property conveying to the purchaser the right, title, and interest acquired or held by each taxing unit that was a party to the judgment foreclosing tax liens on the property. The conveyance is subject to any remaining right of redemption at the time of the sale and to the purchaser's obligation to pay the prorated taxes for the current year as provided by Section 
26.10
. The deed must recite that the liens foreclosed by the judgment and the post-judgment tax liens are discharged and extinguished by virtue of the conveyance.
(l)  A taxing unit that does not consent to a sale under Subsection (j) is liable to the taxing unit that purchased the property for a pro rata share of the costs incurred by the purchasing unit in maintaining the property, including the costs of preventing the property from becoming a public nuisance, a danger to the public, or a threat to the public health. The nonconsenting unit's share of the costs described by this subsection is calculated from the date the unit fails to consent to the sale and is equal to the percentage of the proceeds from a sale of the property to which the nonconsenting unit would be entitled multiplied by the costs incurred by the purchasing unit to maintain the property.

(a)  A municipality is authorized to resell tax foreclosed property for less than the market value specified in the judgment of foreclosure or less than the total amount of the judgments against the property if consent to the conveyance is evidenced by an interlocal agreement between the municipality and each taxing unit that is a party to the judgment, provided, however, that the interlocal agreement complies with the requirements of Subsection (b).
(b)  Any taxing unit may enter into an interlocal agreement with the municipality for the resale of tax foreclosed properties to be used for a purpose consistent with the municipality's urban redevelopment plans or the municipality's affordable housing policy.  If the tax foreclosed property is resold pursuant to this section to be used for a purpose consistent with the municipality's urban redevelopment plan or affordable housing policy, the deed of conveyance must refer to or set forth the applicable terms of the urban redevelopment plan or affordable housing policy.  Any such interlocal agreement should include the following:
(1)  a general statement and goals of the municipality's urban redevelopment plans or affordable housing policy, as applicable;
(2)  a statement that the interlocal agreement concerns only tax foreclosed property that is either vacant or distressed and has a tax delinquency of six or more years;
(3)  a statement that the properties will be used only for a purpose consistent with an urban redevelopment plan or affordable housing policy, as applicable, that is primarily aimed at providing housing for families of low or moderate income;
(4)  a statement that the principal goal of the interlocal agreement is to provide an efficient mechanism for returning deteriorated or unproductive properties to the tax rolls, enhancing the value of ownership to the surrounding properties, and improving the safety and quality of life in deteriorating neighborhoods;  and
(5)  a provision that all properties are sold subject to any right of redemption.
(c)  The deed of conveyance of property sold under this section conveys to the purchaser the right, title, and interest acquired or held by each taxing unit that was a party to the judgment of foreclosure, subject to any remaining right of redemption at the time of the sale.
(d)  An action attacking the validity of a sale of property pursuant to this section may not be instituted after the expiration of one year after the date of the sale and then only after the unconditional tender into the registry of the court of an amount equal to all taxes, penalties, interest, costs, and post-judgment interest of all judgments on which the original foreclosure sale was based.

In a suit filed under this subsection, the purchaser may include a claim for, and is entitled to recover, any excess proceeds of the sale that remain on deposit in the registry of the court or, in the alternative, is entitled to have judgment against any party to whom the excess proceeds have been distributed.

(2)  that the owner has made diligent search in the county in which the property is located for the purchaser at the tax sale or for the purchaser at resale, and has failed to find the purchaser, that the purchaser is not a resident of the county in which the property is located, that the owner and the purchaser cannot agree on the amount of redemption money due, or that the purchaser refuses to give the owner a quitclaim deed to the property.

(3)  "Purchaser" includes a taxing unit to which property is bid off under Section 
34.01
.
(4)  "Residence homestead" has the meaning assigned by Section 
11.13

(i)  The owner of property who is entitled to redeem the property under this section may request that the purchaser of the property, or the taxing unit to which the property was bid off, provide that owner a written itemization of all amounts spent by the purchaser or taxing unit in costs on the property.

(k)  The inclusion of dues and assessments for maintenance paid to a property owners' association within the definition of "costs" under Subsection (g) may not be construed as:
(1)  a waiver of any immunity to which a taxing unit may be entitled from a suit or from liability for those dues or assessments;  or
(2)  authority for a taxing unit to make an expenditure of public funds in violation of Section 
50
,

Sec. 41.4115.  FORFEITURE OF REMEDY FOR NONPAYMENT OF TAXES.  (a)  The pendency of a protest under Section 
41.411
 does not affect the delinquency date for the taxes on the property subject to the protest.  However, that delinquency date applies only to the amount of taxes required to be paid under Subsection (b) and, for purposes of Subsection (b), that delinquency date is postponed to the 125th day after the date one or more taxing units first delivered written notice of the taxes due on the property, as determined by the appraisal review board at a hearing under Section 
41.44
(c-3).  If the property owner complies with Subsection (b), the delinquency date for any additional amount of taxes due on the property is determined in the manner provided by Section 
42.42
(c) for the determination of the delinquency date for additional taxes finally determined to be due in an appeal under Chapter 
42
, and that additional amount is not delinquent before that date.
(b)  Except as provided in Subsection (d), a property owner who files a protest under Section 
41.411
 must pay the amount of taxes due on the portion of the taxable value of the property subject to the protest that is not in dispute before the delinquency date or the property owner forfeits the right to proceed to a final determination of the protest.
(c)  A property owner who pays an amount of taxes greater than that required by Subsection (b) does not forfeit the property owner's right to a final determination of the protest by making the payment.  If the property owner files a timely protest under Section 
41.411
, taxes paid on the property are considered paid under protest, even if paid before the protest is filed.
(d)  After filing an oath of inability to pay the taxes at issue, a property owner may be excused from the requirement of prepayment of tax as a prerequisite to the determination of a protest if the appraisal review board, after notice and hearing, finds that such prepayment would constitute an unreasonable restraint on the property owner's right of access to the board.  On the motion of a party, the board shall hold a hearing to review and determine compliance with this section, and the reviewing board may set such terms and conditions on any grant of relief as may be reasonably required by the circumstances.  If the board determines that the property owner has not substantially complied with this section, the board shall dismiss the pending protest.  If the board determines that the property owner has substantially but not fully complied with this section, the board shall dismiss the pending protest unless the property owner fully complies with the board's determination within 30 days of the determination.

(b)  A person leasing real property who is contractually obligated to reimburse the property owner for taxes imposed on the property is entitled to protest before the appraisal review board a determination of the appraised value of the property if the property owner does not file a protest relating to the property.

Failure of the property owner to send a copy of the notice to the person leasing the property does not affect the time within which the person leasing the property may protest the appraised value.  This subsection does not apply if the property owner and the person leasing the property have agreed in the contract to waive the requirements of this subsection or that the person leasing the property will not protest the appraised value of the property.
(e)  A person leasing real property under a contract described by Subsection (b) may request that the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the property is located send the notice described by Subsection (d) to the person.

(b-1)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 357 (H.B. 
2228
), Sec. 6, eff. January 1, 2018.
(c)  A property owner who files notice of a protest authorized by Section 
41.411
 is entitled to a hearing and determination of the protest if the property owner files the notice prior to the date the taxes on the property to which the notice applies become delinquent.  An owner of land who files a notice of protest under Subsection (a)(3) is entitled to a hearing and determination of the protest without regard to whether the appraisal records are approved.
(c-1)  A property owner who files a notice of protest after the deadline prescribed by Subsection (a) but before the taxes on the property to which the notice applies become delinquent is entitled to a hearing and determination of the protest if the property owner was continuously employed in the Gulf of Mexico, including employment on an offshore drilling or production facility or on a vessel, for a period of not less than 20 days during which the deadline prescribed by Subsection (a) passed, and the property owner provides the appraisal review board with evidence of that fact through submission of a letter from the property owner's employer or supervisor or, if the property owner is self-employed, a sworn affidavit.
(c-2)  A property owner who files a notice of protest after the deadline prescribed by Subsection (a) but before the taxes on the property to which the notice applies become delinquent is entitled to a hearing and determination of the protest if the property owner was serving on full-time active duty in the United States armed forces outside the United States on the day on which the deadline prescribed by Subsection (a) passed and the property owner provides the appraisal review board with evidence of that fact through submission of a valid military identification card from the United States Department of Defense and a deployment order.
(c-3)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c), a property owner who files a protest under Section 
41.411
 on or after the date the taxes on the property to which the notice applies become delinquent, but not later than the 125th day after the property owner, in the protest filed, claims to have first received written notice of the taxes in question, is entitled to a hearing solely on the issue of whether one or more taxing units timely delivered a tax bill.  If at the hearing the appraisal review board determines that all of the taxing units failed to timely deliver a tax bill, the board shall determine the date on which at least one taxing unit first delivered written notice of the taxes in question, and for the purposes of this section the delinquency date is postponed to the 125th day after that date.
(d)  A notice of protest is sufficient if it identifies the protesting property owner, including a person claiming an ownership interest in the property even if that person is not listed on the appraisal records as an owner of the property, identifies the property that is the subject of the protest, and indicates apparent dissatisfaction with some determination of the appraisal office.  The notice need not be on an official form, but the comptroller shall prescribe a form that provides for more detail about the nature of the protest.  The form must permit a property owner to include each property in the appraisal district that is the subject of a protest.  If the form includes boxes a property owner is required to select from to indicate the reason the owner is filing a protest, the form must permit a property owner who believes that the owner's property was appraised at a value that exceeds its appraised value, was appraised unequally, or both, to select a single box to indicate that the owner is filing a protest for either or both reasons.  The form must permit a property owner to request that the protest be heard by a special panel established under Section 
6.425
 if the protest will be determined by an appraisal review board to which that section applies and the property is included in a classification described by Section 
6.425
(b).  The form must permit a property owner to request that the protest be heard by a single-member panel authorized by Section 
41.45
(b-4). The comptroller, each appraisal office, and each appraisal review board shall make the forms readily available and deliver one to a property owner on request.
(e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a notice of protest may not be found to be untimely or insufficient based on a finding of incorrect ownership if the notice:
(1)  identifies as the property owner a person who is, for the tax year at issue:
(A)  an owner of the property at any time during the tax year;
(B)  the person shown on the appraisal records as the owner of the property, if that person filed the protest;
(C)  a lessee authorized to file a protest; or
(D)  an affiliate of or entity related to a person described by this subdivision; or
(2)  uses a misnomer of a person described by Subdivision (1).

(2)  the board proposes that the hearing be conducted by telephone conference call or videoconference and the property owner agrees to the hearing being conducted in that manner.
 
Text of subsection as amended by Acts 2021, 87th Leg., R.S., Ch. 644 (H.B. 
988
), Sec. 17

(b-2)  If a property owner elects to have a hearing on a protest conducted by telephone conference call or videoconference, the appraisal review board shall:

(2)  hold the hearing in a location equipped with equipment that allows each board member and the other parties to the protest who are present at the hearing to hear and, if applicable, see the property owner offer argument.
(b-3)  A property owner is responsible for providing access to a hearing on a protest conducted by telephone conference call or videoconference to another person that the owner invites to participate in the hearing.
(b-4)  An appraisal review board shall sit in a single-member panel to conduct a protest hearing under this section if the property owner requests that the hearing be conducted by a single-member panel:
(1)  in the notice of protest; or
(2)  in writing submitted to the board not later than the 10th day before the date of the hearing.
(b-5)  If the recommendation of a single-member panel that conducts a hearing under Subsection (b-4) is not accepted by the appraisal review board, the board may refer the matter for rehearing to a single-member panel composed of a member who did not hear the original protest or the board may determine the protest.
(b-6)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an appraisal review board is not required to conduct a hearing by videoconference if the board:
(1)  is established for a county with a population of less than 100,000; and 
(2)  lacks the technological capability to conduct a videoconference.
(c)  The chief appraiser shall appear at each protest hearing before the appraisal review board to represent the appraisal office.
(d)  This subsection does not apply to a single-member panel established under Subsection (b-4) of this section or a special panel established under Section 
6.425
.  An appraisal review board consisting of more than three members may sit in panels of not fewer than three members to conduct protest hearings.

(e)  On request made to the appraisal review board before the date of the hearing, a property owner who has not designated an agent under Section 
1.111
 to represent the owner at the hearing is entitled to one postponement of the hearing to a later date without showing cause.  In addition and without limitation as to the number of postponements, the board shall postpone the hearing to a later date if the property owner or the owner's agent at any time shows good cause for the postponement or if the chief appraiser consents to the postponement.  The hearing may not be postponed to a date less than five or more than 30 days after the date scheduled for the hearing when the postponement is sought unless the date and time of the hearing as postponed are agreed to by the chairman of the appraisal review board or the chairman's representative, the property owner, and the chief appraiser.  A request by a property owner for a postponement under this subsection may be made in writing, including by facsimile transmission or electronic mail, by telephone, or in person to the appraisal review board, a panel of the board, or the chairman of the board.  The chairman or the chairman's representative may take action on a postponement under this subsection without the necessity of action by the full board if the hearing for which the postponement is requested is scheduled to occur before the next regular meeting of the board.  The granting by the appraisal review board, the chairman, or the chairman's representative of a postponement under this subsection does not require the delivery of additional written notice to the property owner.
(e-1)  A property owner or a person designated by the property owner as the owner's agent to represent the owner at the hearing who fails to appear at the hearing is entitled to a new hearing if the property owner or the owner's agent files, not later than the fourth day after the date the hearing occurred, a written statement with the appraisal review board showing good cause for the failure to appear and requesting a new hearing.
(e-2)  For purposes of Subsections (e) and (e-1), "good cause" means a reason that includes an error or mistake that:
(1)  was not intentional or the result of conscious indifference; and
(2)  will not cause undue delay or other injury to the person authorized to extend the deadline or grant a rescheduling.
(f)  A property owner who has been denied a hearing to which the property owner is entitled under this chapter may bring suit against the appraisal review board by filing a petition or application in district court to compel the board to provide the hearing.  If the property owner is entitled to the hearing, the court shall order the hearing to be held and may award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to the property owner.
(g)  In addition to the grounds for a postponement under Subsection (e), the board shall postpone the hearing to a later date if:
(1)  the owner of the property or the owner's agent is also scheduled to appear at a hearing on a protest filed with the appraisal review board of another appraisal district;
(2)  the hearing before the other appraisal review board is scheduled to occur on the same date as the hearing set by the appraisal review board from which the postponement is sought;
(3)  the notice of hearing delivered to the property owner or the owner's agent by the other appraisal review board bears an earlier postmark than the notice of hearing delivered by the board from which the postponement is sought or, if the date of the postmark is identical, the property owner or agent has not requested a postponement of the other hearing;  and
(4)  the property owner or the owner's agent includes with the request for a postponement a copy of the notice of hearing delivered to the property owner or the owner's agent by the other appraisal review board.
(h)  Before the hearing on a protest or immediately after the hearing begins, the chief appraiser and the property owner or the owner's agent shall each provide the other with a copy of any written material or material preserved on a portable device designed to maintain a reproduction of a document or image that the person intends to offer or submit to the appraisal review board at the hearing.  Each person must provide the copy of material in the manner and form prescribed by comptroller rule.
(i)  To be valid, an affidavit offered under Subsection (b) must be attested to before an officer authorized to administer oaths and include:
(1)  the name of the property owner initiating the protest;
(2)  a description of the property that is the subject of the protest;  and
(3)  evidence or argument.
(j)  A statement from the property owner that specifies the determination or other action of the chief appraiser, appraisal district, or appraisal review board relating to the subject property from which the property owner seeks relief constitutes sufficient argument under Subsection (i).
(k)  The comptroller shall prescribe a standard form for an affidavit offered under Subsection (b).  Each appraisal district shall make copies of the affidavit form available to property owners without charge.
(l)  A property owner is not required to use the affidavit form prescribed by the comptroller when offering an affidavit under Subsection (b).
(m)  If the protest relates to a taxable leasehold or other possessory interest in real property that is owned by this state or a political subdivision of this state, the attorney general or a representative of the state agency that owns the land, if the real property is owned by this state, or a person designated by the political subdivision that owns the real property, as applicable, is entitled to appear at the hearing and offer evidence and argument.
(n)  A property owner does not waive the right to appear in person at a protest hearing by submitting an affidavit to the appraisal review board or by electing to appear by telephone conference call or videoconference.  The board may consider an affidavit submitted under this section only if the property owner does not appear in person at the hearing.  For purposes of scheduling the hearing, the property owner must state in the affidavit that the property owner does not intend to appear at the hearing or that the property owner intends to appear at the hearing in person or by telephone conference call or videoconference and that the affidavit may be used only if the property owner does not appear at the hearing in person.  If the property owner does not state in the affidavit whether the owner intends to appear at the hearing and has not elected to appear by telephone conference call or videoconference, the board shall consider the submission of the affidavit as an indication that the property owner does not intend to appear at the hearing.  If the property owner states in the affidavit that the owner does not intend to appear at the hearing or does not state in the affidavit whether the owner intends to appear at the hearing and has not elected to appear by telephone conference call or videoconference, the board is not required to consider the affidavit at the scheduled hearing and may consider the affidavit at a hearing designated for the specific purpose of processing affidavits.
(o)  If the chief appraiser uses audiovisual equipment at a hearing on a protest, the appraisal office shall provide audiovisual equipment of the same general type, kind, and character, as prescribed by comptroller rule, for use during the hearing by the property owner or the property owner's agent.
(p)  The comptroller by rule shall prescribe:
(1)  the manner and form, including security requirements, in which a person must provide a copy of material under Subsection (h), which must allow the appraisal review board to retain the material as part of the board's hearing record; and
(2)  specifications for the audiovisual equipment provided by an appraisal district for use by a property owner or the property owner's agent under Subsection (o).

If the hearing is not commenced within two hours of the time set for the hearing, the appraisal review board shall postpone the hearing on the request of the property owner or the designated agent of the owner.
(j)  On the request of a property owner or the designated agent of the owner, an appraisal review board shall schedule hearings on protests concerning up to 20 designated properties to be held consecutively on the same day.  The designated properties must be identified in the same notice of protest, and the notice must contain in boldfaced type the statement "request for same-day protest hearings."  A property owner or the designated agent of the owner may file more than one request under this subsection with the appraisal review board in the same tax year.

(j-1)  An appraisal review board may schedule the hearings on all protests filed by a property owner or the designated agent of the owner to be held consecutively.  The notice of the hearings must state the date and time that the first hearing will begin, state the date the last hearing will end, and list the order in which the hearings will be held.  The order of the hearings listed in the notice may not be changed without the agreement of the property owner or the designated agent of the owner, the chief appraiser, and the appraisal review board.  The board may not reschedule a hearing for which notice is given under this subsection to a date earlier than the seventh day after the date the last hearing was scheduled to end unless agreed to by the property owner or the designated agent of the owner, the chief appraiser, and the appraisal review board.

If a protest is scheduled to be heard by a particular panel, the protest may not be reassigned to another panel without the consent of the property owner or the designated agent of the owner.  If the appraisal review board has cause to reassign a protest to another panel, a property owner or the designated agent of the owner may agree to reassignment of the protest or may request that the hearing on the protest be postponed.  The board shall postpone the hearing on that request.  A change of members of a panel because of a conflict of interest, illness, or inability to continue participating in hearings for the remainder of the day does not constitute reassignment of a protest to another panel.
(k-1)  On the request of a property owner or the designated agent of the owner, an appraisal review board to which Section 
6.425
 applies shall assign a protest relating to property described by Section 
6.425

6.425
(b) to a special panel as authorized by Section 
6.425
(f), but only if the assignment is requested or consented to by the property owner or the designated agent of the owner.  Protests assigned to special panels shall be randomly assigned to those panels.

If the board has cause to reassign a protest to another special panel, a property owner or the designated agent of the owner may agree to reassignment of the protest or may request that the hearing on the protest be postponed.  The board shall postpone the hearing on that request.  A change of members of a special panel because of a conflict of interest, illness, or inability to continue participating in hearings for the remainder of the day does not constitute reassignment of a protest to another special panel.
(l)  A property owner, attorney, or agent offering evidence or argument in support of a protest brought under Section 
41.41
(a)(1) or (2) of this code is not subject to Chapter

5.103
 or is not complying with procedural requirements under this chapter.  The taxpayer liaison officer shall investigate the complaint and report the findings of the investigation to the board of directors of the appraisal district.  The board of directors shall direct the chairman of the appraisal review board to take remedial action if, after reviewing the taxpayer liaison officer's report, the board of directors determines that the allegations contained in the complaint are true. The board of directors may refer the matter to the local administrative district judge with a recommendation that the judge remove the member of the appraisal review board serving as chairman of the appraisal review board from that member's position as chairman if the board determines that the chairman has failed to take the actions necessary to bring the appraisal review board into compliance with Section 
5.103
(d) or this chapter, as applicable.  If the local administrative district judge agrees with the board's recommendation, the judge shall remove the chairman from that office and appoint another member of the appraisal review board as chairman.

(1)  comply with the hearing procedures adopted by the appraisal review board under Section 
41.01

(c)  Except as otherwise provided by this subtitle, the failure to comply with a procedural requirement listed under Subsection (a) is not a ground for postponement of a hearing on a protest.

41A.07
(h) does not apply to the appointment of an arbitrator under this section.
(h)  The appraisal review board, the chief appraiser, and the property owner are parties to a limited binding arbitration conducted under this section.

The property owner may appear in the manner provided by Section 
41A.08
(b)(2), (3), (4), or (5).
(i)  The arbitrator shall make an arbitration award and deliver an electronic copy of the award to:
(1)  the property owner;
(2)  the chairman of the appraisal review board;
(3)  the chief appraiser; and
(4)  the comptroller.
(j)  An award under this section:
(1)  shall include a determination of whether the appraisal review board or chief appraiser failed to comply with a procedural requirement as alleged in the request for limited binding arbitration;
(2)  if the arbitrator determines that the appraisal review board or chief appraiser failed to comply with a procedural requirement as alleged in the request, shall direct the appraisal review board or chief appraiser, as applicable, to:
(A)  comply with the procedural requirement; or
(B)  if the hearing on the protest has been held and the appraisal review board has issued an order determining the protest, rescind the order and hold a new hearing on the protest that complies with the procedural requirement;
(3)  shall specify the arbitrator's fee;
(4)  is final and may not be appealed; and
(5)  is enforceable as provided by Section

41A.05
(b); and
(2)  the appraisal district shall pay the arbitrator's fee.
(l)  If the arbitrator determines that the appraisal review board or chief appraiser complied with the procedural requirement that was the subject of the limited binding arbitration, the comptroller shall:

(1)  appeal the final determination of a protest by the appraisal review board under Chapter 
42
; or
(2)  pursue any other legal or statutory remedy available to the property owner.
(o)  A property owner may request a single limited binding arbitration under this section that covers more than one property, more than one protest hearing, or an allegation of the failure by the appraisal review board or chief appraiser to comply with more than one procedural requirement so long as the requirements of Subsection (b) are met with regard to each alleged failure to comply.  The amount of the arbitration deposit and the amount of the arbitrator's fee are computed as if a single property were the subject of the arbitration.  If the arbitration involves property described by Subsection (e)(1) and property described by Subsection (e)(2), the amount of the arbitration deposit and the amount of the arbitrator's fee are computed as if only the property described by Subsection (e)(2) were the subject of the arbitration.  If the arbitration involves an allegation of the failure by the appraisal review board or chief appraiser to comply with more than one procedural requirement, Subsection (k) applies if the arbitrator determines that the appraisal review board or chief appraiser failed to comply with one or more of the procedural requirements that were the subject of the arbitration and Subsection (l) applies if the arbitrator determines that the appraisal review board or chief appraiser complied with all of the procedural requirements that were the subject of the arbitration.
(p)  Section 
41A.06
 applies to the registration and qualification of an arbitrator under this section except that an arbitrator under this section must:

(2)  agree to conduct an arbitration for a fee that is not more than:
(A)  $400 if the property is described by Subsection (e)(1); or

(1)  a completed request for binding arbitration under this chapter in the form prescribed by Section

(E)  $1,050, if the property does not qualify as the owner's residence homestead under Section

Sec. 42.08.  FORFEITURE OF REMEDY FOR NONPAYMENT OF TAXES.  (a)  The pendency of an appeal as provided by this chapter does not affect the delinquency date for the taxes on the property subject to the appeal.  However, that delinquency date applies only to the amount of taxes required to be paid under Subsection (b).  If the property owner complies with Subsection (b), the delinquency date for any additional amount of taxes due on the property is determined by Section 
42.42
(c), and that additional amount is not delinquent before that date.
(b)  Except as provided in Subsection (d), a property owner who appeals as provided by this chapter must pay taxes on the property subject to the appeal in the amount required by this subsection before the delinquency date or the property owner forfeits the right to proceed to a final determination of the appeal.  The amount of taxes the property owner must pay on the property before the delinquency date to comply with this subsection is the lesser of:
(1)  the amount of taxes due on the portion of the taxable value of the property that is not in dispute;
(2)  the amount of taxes due on the property under the order from which the appeal is taken; or
(3)  the amount of taxes imposed on the property in the preceding tax year.
(b-1)  This subsection applies only to an appeal in which the property owner elects to pay the amount of taxes described by Subsection (b)(1).  The appeal filed by the property owner must be accompanied by a statement in writing of the amount of taxes the property owner proposes to pay.  The failure to provide the statement required by this subsection is not a jurisdictional error.
(c)  A property owner that pays an amount of taxes greater than that required by Subsection (b) does not forfeit the property owner's right to a final determination of the appeal by making the payment.  The property owner may pay an additional amount of taxes at any time.  If the property owner files a timely appeal under this chapter, taxes paid on the property are considered paid under protest, even if paid before the appeal is filed.  If the taxes are subject to the split-payment option provided by Section 
31.03
, the property owner may comply with Subsection (b) of this section by paying one-half of the amount otherwise required to be paid under that subsection before December 1 and paying the remaining one-half of that amount before July 1 of the following year.
(d)  After filing an oath of inability to pay the taxes at issue, a party may be excused from the requirement of prepayment of tax as a prerequisite to appeal if the court, after notice and hearing, finds that such prepayment would constitute an unreasonable restraint on the party's right of access to the courts.  On the motion of a party and after the movant's compliance with Subsection (e), the court shall hold a hearing to review and determine compliance with this section, and the reviewing court may set such terms and conditions on any grant of relief as may be reasonably required by the circumstances.  If the court determines that the property owner has not substantially complied with this section, the court shall dismiss the pending action.  If the court determines that the property owner has substantially but not fully complied with this section, the court shall dismiss the pending action unless the property owner fully complies with the court's determination within 30 days of the determination.
(e)  Not later than the 45th day before the date of a hearing to review and determine compliance with this section, the movant must mail notice of the hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the collector for each taxing unit that imposes taxes on the property.
(f)  Regardless of whether the collector for the taxing unit receives a notice under Subsection (e), a taxing unit that imposes taxes on the property may intervene in an appeal under this chapter and participate in the proceedings for the limited purpose of determining whether the property owner has complied with this section.  The taxing unit is entitled to process for witnesses and evidence and to be heard by the court.

(1)  in defense to a suit to enforce collection of delinquent taxes;  or
(2)  as a basis of a claim for relief in a suit by the property owner to arrest or prevent the tax collection process or to obtain a refund of taxes paid.
(b)  A person against whom a suit to collect a delinquent property tax is filed may plead as an affirmative defense:
(1)  if the suit is to enforce personal liability for the tax, that the defendant did not own the property on which the tax was imposed on January 1 of the year for which the tax was imposed;  or
(2)  if the suit is to foreclose a lien securing the payment of a tax on real property, that the property was not located within the boundaries of the taxing unit seeking to foreclose the lien on January 1 of the year for which the tax was imposed.
(c)  For purposes of this section, "suit" includes a counterclaim, cross-claim, or other claim filed in the course of a lawsuit.

SUBCHAPTER B. REVIEW BY DISTRICT COURT
Sec. 42.21.  PETITION FOR REVIEW.  (a)  A party who appeals as provided by this chapter must file a petition for review with the district court within 60 days after the party received notice that a final order has been entered from which an appeal may be had or at any time after the hearing but before the 60-day deadline.  Failure to timely file a petition bars any appeal under this chapter.
(b)  A petition for review brought under Section 
42.02
 must be brought against the owner of the property involved in the appeal.  A petition for review brought under Section 
42.031
 must be brought against the appraisal district and against the owner of the property involved in the appeal.  A petition for review brought under Section 
42.01
(a)(2) or 
42.03
 must be brought against the comptroller.  Any other petition for review under this chapter must be brought against the appraisal district.  A petition for review may not be brought against the appraisal review board.  An appraisal district may hire an attorney that represents the district to represent the appraisal review board established for the district to file an answer and obtain a dismissal of a suit filed against the appraisal review board in violation of this subsection.
(c)  If an appeal under this chapter is pending when the appraisal review board issues an order in a subsequent year under a protest by the same property owner and that protest relates to the same property that is involved in the pending appeal, the property owner may appeal the subsequent appraisal review board order by amending the original petition for the pending appeal to include the grounds for appealing the subsequent order.  The amended petition must be filed with the court in the period provided by Subsection (a) for filing a petition for review of the subsequent order.  A property owner may appeal the subsequent appraisal review board order under this subsection or may appeal the order independently of the pending appeal as otherwise provided by this section, but may not do both.  A property owner may change the election of remedies provided by this subsection at any time before the end of the period provided by Subsection (a) for filing a petition for review.
(d)  An appraisal district is served by service on the chief appraiser at any time or by service on any other officer or employee of the appraisal district present at the appraisal office at a time when the appraisal office is open for business with the public.  An appraisal review board is served by service on the chairman of the appraisal review board.  Citation of a party is issued and served in the manner provided by law for civil suits generally.
(e)  A petition that is timely filed under Subsection (a) or amended under Subsection (c) may be subsequently amended to:
(1)  correct or change the name of a party;  or
(2)  not later than the 120th day before the date of trial, identify or describe the property originally involved in the appeal.
(f)  A petition filed by an owner or lessee of property may include multiple properties that are owned or leased by the same person and are of a similar type or are part of the same economic unit and would typically sell as a single property.  If a petition is filed by multiple plaintiffs or includes multiple properties that are not of a similar type, are not part of the same economic unit, or are part of the same economic unit but would not typically sell as a single property, the court may on motion and a showing of good cause sever the plaintiffs or the properties.
(g)  A petition filed by an owner or lessee of property may be amended to include additional properties in the same county that are owned or leased by the same person, are of a similar type as the property originally involved in the appeal or are part of the same economic unit as the property originally involved in the appeal and would typically sell as a single property, and are the subject of an appraisal review board order issued in the same year as the order that is the subject of the original appeal.  The amendment must be filed within the period during which a petition for review of the appraisal review board order pertaining to the additional properties would be required to be filed under Subsection (a).
(h)  The court has jurisdiction over an appeal under this chapter brought on behalf of a property owner or lessee and the owner or lessee is considered to have exhausted the owner's or lessee's administrative remedies regardless of whether the petition correctly identifies the plaintiff as the owner or lessee of the property or correctly describes the property so long as the property was the subject of an appraisal review board order, the petition was filed within the period required by Subsection (a), and the petition provides sufficient information to identify the property that is the subject of the petition.  Whether the plaintiff is the proper party to bring the petition or whether the property needs to be further identified or described must be addressed by means of a special exception and correction of the petition by amendment as authorized by Subsection (e) and may not be the subject of a plea to the jurisdiction or a claim that the plaintiff has failed to exhaust the plaintiff's administrative remedies.  If the petition is amended to add a plaintiff, the court on  motion shall enter a docket control order to provide proper deadlines in response to the addition of the plaintiff.

, or Section 
25.25
, as applicable.
(d)  A determination of the appraisal review board relating to the remanded action may be appealed to the court that remanded the action to the board.

5.10

Sec. 111.0043.  GENERAL AUDIT AND PREHEARING POWERS.  (a)  In this section:
(1)  "Person" includes an individual, corporation, partner, partnership, officer, or director of a corporation, joint venture, trust, trustee, agent, or association.
(2)  "Taxpayer" means the person whose tax obligation the comptroller is seeking to determine.
(b)(1) Before a determination of or a hearing on a taxpayer's tax obligation, if any, the comptroller may issue a subpoena addressed to the sheriff or constable of any county in this state to require any person who the comptroller determines may provide assistance in the examination of a taxpayer's tax obligation to appear at the place and time stated in the subpoena for the taking of his oral deposition before an official authorized to take depositions.  The subpoena may require the person to produce at the time of the deposition books, documents, records, papers, accounts, and other objects as may be specified by the comptroller.  The subpoena must include a statement setting out the reason why the requested material is needed.
(2)  The deposition shall be taken in the county of the person's residence or in the county where the person is employed or regularly transacts business.  The subpoena shall specify that the person shall remain in attendance from day to day until the deposition is begun and completed.
(3)  The officer taking the oral deposition may not sustain objections to any of the testimony taken or exclude any of it.
(4)  When the testimony is fully transcribed, the deposition shall be submitted to the person for examination and read to or by the person, unless the examination and reading are waived in writing by the person and by the comptroller.  However, if the person is represented by an attorney of record, the deposition officer shall notify the attorney of record in writing by registered mail or certified mail that the deposition is ready for examination and reading at the office of the deposition officer.  If the person does not appear and examine, read, and sign the deposition within 10 days after the mailing of the notice, the deposition shall be returned and may be used as fully as though signed.  The officer shall enter on the deposition any changes in form or substance that the person desires to make and a statement of the reasons given by the person for making them.  The deposition shall then be signed by the person, unless the person and the comptroller by stipulation waive the signing or the person is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign.  If the deposition is not signed by the person, the officer shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver, illness, or absence of the person or the fact of the refusal to sign, together with the reason, if any, given for failure to sign.  The deposition may then be used as fully as though signed.
(5)  The deposition shall be returned to the comptroller by the official taking the deposition either by mail or by delivering it in person.
(c)  Before a determination of or a hearing on a taxpayer's tax obligation, if any, the comptroller may:
(1)  issue a subpoena addressed to the sheriff or constable of any county in this state to require any person to produce at the place and time stated in the subpoena books, documents, records, papers, accounts, and other objects that the comptroller determines may assist in an examination of a person's tax obligation;
(2)  issue an order to a person to permit entry upon designated land or other property in his possession or control for the purpose of inspecting, measuring, surveying, or photographing the property or any designated object or operation on the property that may be material to any matter involved in the examination;  the order must specify the time, place, and manner of making the inspection, measurement, or survey and taking the copies and photographs and may prescribe any terms and conditions that are just;
(3)  copy or conduct a complete examination of books, documents, records, papers, accounts, and other objects that are produced as a result of the subpoenas or orders specified in this section;  and
(4)  serve or have served by his designated agent any subpoena or order issued under this section by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the person.
(d)  A person, other than the taxpayer, who is subpoenaed to give a deposition or to produce books, records, papers, or other objects under the authority of this section is entitled to receive after presentation of a voucher sworn by the person and approved by the comptroller:
(1)  mileage of 20 cents a mile, or a greater amount as prescribed by agency rule, for going to and returning from the place of the hearing or the place where the deposition is taken, if the place is more than 25 miles from the person's place of residence;  and
(2)  a fee of $20 a day, or a greater amount as prescribed by agency rule, for each day or part of a day the person is necessarily present as a deponent.
(e)  If a person fails to comply with a subpoena or order issued under this section, the comptroller may:
(1)  acting through the attorney general, bring suit to enforce the subpoena or order in a district court of Travis County;  the court, if it determines that good cause exists for the issuance of a subpoena or order, shall order the compliance with the requirements of the subpoena or order;  failure to obey the order of the court may be punishable by the court as contempt;
(2)  use records, books, papers, and other documents obtained or depositions taken under this section only in an administrative hearing of the comptroller or a judicial proceeding brought by or against the comptroller;  the information may be made available to the federal government or to another state under an exchange agreement;  and
(3)  delegate his authority to issue subpoenas or orders and to participate in the taking of depositions as specified in this section to any attorney employed by him.
(f)  If a foreign corporation doing business in this state has such contact with this state that it becomes subject to the taxes administered and collected by the comptroller and fails to appoint or maintain a registered agent in this state, or if the registered agent cannot with reasonable diligence be found at the registered office, then the secretary of state shall be an agent of the corporation and may be served with any subpoena or other order issued under this section in the manner provided for service of process in Article 8.10, Texas Business Corporation Act, as amended.
(g)  Any person, including the taxpayer, shall be entitled to obtain upon request a copy of any statement he has previously made concerning the examination or its subject matter and which is in the possession, custody, or control of the comptroller.  Copies of statements made to the comptroller by any person which are used as a basis for an assessment against a taxpayer may be obtained by the taxpayer upon request.  If the request is refused, the person may move for an agency order under this subsection.  For the purpose of this section, a statement previously made is:
(1)  a written statement signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the person making it;  or
(2)  a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement by the person making it and contemporaneously recorded.

 of this code, the provisions of Subsections (a)(1) and (b) of this section may not apply if, upon petition by the comptroller, the court determines, on the basis of the facts and circumstances alleged, that there is reasonable cause to believe the giving of notice may lead to attempts to conceal, destroy, or alter records relevant to the examination, to prevent the communication of information from other persons through intimidation, bribery, or collusion, or to flee to avoid prosecution, testifying, or production of records.
(g)(1) A district court of Travis County has jurisdiction to hear and determine proceedings brought under Subsection (e) or (f) of this section.

An order denying the petition shall be deemed a final order that may be appealed.
(2)  Except for cases the court considers of greater importance, a proceeding brought for the enforcement of any order, or a proceeding under this section, and appeals, take precedence on the docket over all cases and shall be assigned for hearing and decided at the earliest practicable date.
(h)  The comptroller shall by rule establish the rates and conditions for payments to reimburse reasonably necessary costs directly incurred by third-party recordkeepers in searching for, reproducing, or transporting books, papers, records, or other data required to be produced by order or subpoena upon request of the comptroller.

(2)  on personal property, in the county where the taxpayer resided at the time the tax became due and payable or in the county where the taxpayer filed the report.

ARTICLE III. ELEMENTS OF INCOME TAX LAWS
Taxpayer Option, State and Local Taxes
1. Any taxpayer subject to an income tax whose income is subject to apportionment and allocation for tax purposes pursuant to the laws of a party state or pursuant to the laws of subdivisions in two or more party states may elect to apportion and allocate his income in the manner provided by the laws of such state or by the laws of such states and subdivisions without reference to this compact, or may elect to apportion and allocate in accordance with Article IV.  This election for any tax year may be made in all party states or subdivisions thereof or in any one or more of the party states or subdivisions thereof without reference to the election made in the others.  For the purposes of this paragraph, taxes imposed by subdivisions shall be considered separately from state taxes and the apportionment and allocation also may be applied to the entire tax base.  In no instance wherein Article IV is employed for all subdivisions of a state may the sum of all apportionments and allocations to subdivisions within a state be greater than the apportionment and allocation that would be assignable to that state if the apportionment or allocation were being made with respect to a state income tax.
Taxpayer Option, Short Form
2. Each party state or any subdivision thereof which imposes an income tax shall provide by law that any taxpayer required to file a return, whose only activities within the taxing jurisdiction consist of sales and do not include owning or renting real estate or tangible personal property, and whose dollar volume of gross sales made during the tax year within the state or subdivision, as the case may be, is not in excess of $100,000 may elect to report and pay any tax due on the basis of a percentage of such volume, and shall adopt rates which shall produce a tax which reasonably approximates the tax otherwise due.  The Multistate Tax Commission, not more than once in five years, may adjust the $100,000 figure in order to reflect such changes as may occur in the real value of the dollar, and such adjusted figure, upon adoption by the commission, shall replace the $100,000 figure specifically provided herein.  Each party state and subdivision thereof may make the same election available to taxpayers additional to those specified in this paragraph.
Coverage
3. Nothing in this article relates to the reporting or payment of any tax other than an income tax.
ARTICLE IV. DIVISION OF INCOME
1. As used in this article, unless the context otherwise requires:
(a)  "Business income" means income arising from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business and includes income from tangible and intangible property if the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer's regular trade or business operations.
(b)  "Commercial domicile" means the principal place from which the trade or business of the taxpayer is directed or managed.
(c)  "Compensation" means wages, salaries, commissions and any other form of remuneration paid to employees for personal services.
(d)  "Financial organization" means any bank, trust company, savings bank, industrial bank, land bank, safe deposit company, private banker, savings and loan association, credit union, cooperative bank, small loan company, sales finance company, investment company, or any type of insurance company.

(f)  "Public utility" means any business entity (1) which owns or operates any plant, equipment, property, franchise, or license for the transmission of communications, transportation of goods or persons, except by pipe line, or the production, transmission, sale, delivery, or furnishing of electricity, water or steam;  and (2) whose rates of charges for goods or services have been established or approved by a federal, state or local government or governmental agency.
(g)  "Sales" means all gross receipts of the taxpayer not allocated under paragraphs of this article.
(h)  "State" means any state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, and any foreign country or political subdivision thereof.
(i)  "This state" means the state in which the relevant tax return is filed or, in the case of application of this article to the apportionment and allocation of income for local tax purposes, the subdivision or local taxing district in which the relevant tax return is filed.
2. Any taxpayer having income from business activity which is taxable both within and without this state, other than activity as a financial organization or public utility or the rendering of purely personal services by an individual, shall allocate and apportion his net income as provided in this article.  If a taxpayer has income from business activity as a public utility but derives the greater percentage of his income from activities subject to this article, the taxpayer may elect to allocate and apportion his entire net income as provided in this article.
3. For purposes of allocation and apportionment of income under this article, a taxpayer is taxable in another state if (1) in that state he is subject to a net income tax, a franchise tax measured by net income, a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business, or a corporate stock tax, or (2) that state has jurisdiction to subject the taxpayer to a net income tax regardless of whether, in fact, the state does or does not.
4. Rents and royalties from real or tangible personal property, capital gains, interest, dividends or patent or copyright royalties, to the extent that they constitute nonbusiness income, shall be allocated as provided in paragraphs 5 through 8 of this article.
5. (a) Net rents and royalties from real property located in this state are allocable to this state.
(b)  Net rents and royalties from tangible personal property are allocable to this state:  (1) if and to the extent that the property is utilized in this state, or (2) in their entirety if the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state and the taxpayer is not organized under the laws of or taxable in the state in which the property is utilized.
(c)  The extent of utilization of tangible personal property in a state is determined by multiplying the rents and royalties by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property in the state during the rental or royalty period in the taxable year and the denominator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property everywhere during all rental or royalty periods in the taxable year.  If the physical location of the property during the rental or royalty period is unknown or unascertainable by the taxpayer, tangible personal property is utilized in the state in which the property was located at the time the rental or royalty payer obtained possession.
6. (a) Capital gains and losses from sales of real property located in this state are allocable to this state.
(b)  Capital gains and losses from sales of tangible personal property are allocable to this state if (1) the property had a situs in this state at the time of the sale, or (2) the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state and the taxpayer is not taxable in the state in which the property had a situs.
(c)  Capital gains and losses from sales of intangible personal property are allocable to this state if the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state.
7. Interest and dividends are allocable to this state if the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state.
8. (a) Patent and copyright royalties are allocable to this state:  (1) if and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the payer in this state, or (2) if and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the payer in a state in which the taxpayer is not taxable and the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state.
(b)  A patent is utilized in a state to the extent that it is employed in production, fabrication, manufacturing, or other processing in the state or to the extent that a patented product is produced in the state.  If the basis of receipts from patent royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the patent is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer's commercial domicile is located.
(c)  A copyright is utilized in a state to the extent that printing or other publication originates in the state.  If the basis of receipts from copyright royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the copyright is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer's commercial domicile is located.
9. All business income shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the property factor plus the payroll factor plus the sales factor, and the denominator of which is three.
10. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in this state during the tax period and the denominator of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used during the tax period.
11. Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost.  Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight times the net annual rental rate.  Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from subrentals.
12. The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the tax period but the tax administrator may require the averaging of monthly values during the tax period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the taxpayer's property.
13. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in this state during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period.
14. Compensation is paid in this state if:
(a)  the individual's service is performed entirely within the state;
(b)  the individual's service is performed both within and without the state, but the service performed without the state is incidental to the individual's service within the state;  or
(c)  some of the service is performed in the state and (1) the base of operations or, if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled is in the state, or (2) the base of operations or the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual's residence is in this state.
15. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer in this state during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period.
16. Sales of tangible personal property are in this state if:
(a)  the property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than the United States government, within this state regardless of the f. o. b. point or other conditions of the sale;  or
(b)  the property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory, or other place of storage in this state and (1) the purchaser is the United States government or (2) the taxpayer is not taxable in the state of the purchaser.
17. Sales, other than sales of tangible personal property, are in this state if:
(a)  the income-producing activity is performed in this state;  or
(b)  the income-producing activity is performed both in and outside this state and a greater proportion of the income-producing activity is performed in this state than in any other state, based on costs of performance.
18. If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this article do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in this state, the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrator may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activity, if reasonable:
(a)  separate accounting;
(b)  the exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
(c)  the inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly represent the taxpayer's business activity in this state;  or
(d)  the employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income.
ARTICLE V. ELEMENTS OF SALES AND USE TAX LAWS
Tax Credit
1. Each purchaser liable for a use tax on tangible personal property shall be entitled to full credit for the combined amount or amounts of legally imposed sales or use taxes paid by him with respect to the same property to another state and any subdivision thereof.  The credit shall be applied first against the amount of any use tax due the state, and any unused portion of the credit shall then be applied against the amount of any use tax due a subdivision.
Exemption Certificates, Vendors May Rely
2. Whenever a vendor receives and accepts in good faith from a purchaser a resale or other exemption certificate or other written evidence of exemption authorized by the appropriate state or subdivision taxing authority, the vendor shall be relieved of liability for a sales or use tax with respect to the transaction.
ARTICLE VI. THE COMMISSION
Organization and Management
1. (a) The Multistate Tax Commission is hereby established.  It shall be composed of one "member" from each party state who shall be the head of the state agency charged with the administration of the types of taxes to which this compact applies.  If there is more than one such agency the state shall provide by law for the selection of the commission member from the heads of the relevant agencies.  State law may provide that a member of the commission be represented by an alternate but only if there is on file with the commission written notification of the designation and identity of the alternate.  The attorney general of each party state or his designee, or other counsel if the laws of the party state specifically provide, shall be entitled to attend the meetings of the commission, but shall not vote.  Such attorneys general, designees, or other counsel shall receive all notices of meetings required under paragraph 1(e) of this article.
(b)  Each party state shall provide by law for the selection of representatives from its subdivisions affected by this compact to consult with the commission member from that state.

(d)  The commission shall adopt an official seal to be used as it may provide.
(e)  The commission shall hold an annual meeting and such other regular meetings as its bylaws may provide and such special meetings as its executive committee may determine.

Notices of special meetings shall include the reasons therefor and an agenda of the items to be considered.
(f)  The commission shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice-chairman and a treasurer.  The commission shall appoint an executive director who shall serve at its pleasure, and it shall fix his duties and compensation.  The executive director shall be secretary of the commission.  The commission shall make provision for the bonding of such of its officers and employees as it may deem appropriate.
(g)  Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any party state, the executive director shall appoint or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the functions of the commission and shall fix their duties and compensation.  The commission bylaws shall provide for personnel policies and programs.
(h)  The commission may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any state, the United States, or any other governmental entity.

The commission may make additional reports as it may deem desirable.
Committees

(a) To assist in the conduct of its business when the full commission is not meeting, the commission shall have an executive committee of seven members, including the chairman, vice-chairman, treasurer and four other members elected annually by the commission.  The executive committee, subject to the provisions of this compact and consistent with the policies of the commission, shall function as provided in the bylaws of the commission.
(b)  The commission may establish advisory and technical committees, membership on which may include private persons and public officials, in furthering any of its activities.  Such committees may consider any matter of concern to the commission, including problems of special interest to any party state and problems dealing with particular types of taxes.
(c)  The commission may establish such additional committees as its bylaws may provide.
Powers
3. In addition to powers conferred elsewhere in this compact, the commission shall have power to:
(a)  Study state and local tax systems and particular types of state and local taxes.
(b)  Develop and recommend proposals for an increase in uniformity or compatibility of state and local tax laws with a view toward encouraging the simplification and improvement of state and local tax law and administration.
(c)  Compile and publish information as in its judgment would assist the party states in implementation of the compact and taxpayers in complying with state and local tax laws.

(b)  Each of the commission's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states.  The total amount of appropriations requested under any such budget shall be apportioned among the party states as follows:  one-tenth in equal shares;  and the remainder in proportion to the amount of revenue collected by each party state and its subdivisions from income taxes, capital stock taxes, gross receipts taxes, sales and use taxes.  In determining such amounts, the commission shall employ such available public sources of information as, in its judgment, present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states.  Each of the commission's budgets of estimated expenditures and requests for appropriations shall indicate the sources used in obtaining information employed in applying the formula contained in this paragraph.
(c)  The commission shall not pledge the credit of any party state.  The commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under paragraph 1(i) of this article:  provided that the commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner.  Except where the commission makes use of funds available to it under paragraph 1(i), the commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same.
(d)  The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.  The receipts and disbursements of the commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws.  All receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the commission.
(e)  The accounts of the commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the commission.
(f)  Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to prevent commission compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the commission.
ARTICLE VII. UNIFORM REGULATIONS AND FORMS
1. Whenever any two or more party states, or subdivisions of party states, have uniform or similar provisions of law relating to an income tax, capital stock tax, gross receipts tax, sales or use tax, the commission may adopt uniform regulations for any phase of the administration of such law, including assertion of jurisdiction to tax, or prescribing uniform tax forms.  The commission may also act with respect to the provisions of Article IV of this compact.
2. Prior to the adoption of any regulation, the commission shall:
(a)  As provided in its bylaws, hold at least one public hearing on due notice to all affected party states and subdivisions thereof and to all taxpayers and other persons who have made timely request of the commission for advance notice of its regulation-making proceedings.
(b)  Afford all affected party states and subdivisions and interested persons an opportunity to submit relevant written data and views, which shall be considered fully by the commission.
3. The commission shall submit any regulations adopted by it to the appropriate officials of all party states and subdivisions to which they might apply.  Each such state and subdivision shall consider any such regulation for adoption in accordance with its own laws and procedures.
ARTICLE VIII. INTERSTATE AUDITS
1. This article shall be in force only in those party states that specifically provide therefor by statute.
2. Any party state or subdivision thereof desiring to make or participate in an audit of any accounts, books, papers, records or other documents may request the commission to perform the audit on its behalf.  In responding to the request, the commission shall have access to and may examine, at any reasonable time, such accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents and any relevant property or stock of merchandise.  The commission may enter into agreements with party states or their subdivisions for assistance in performance of the audit.  The commission shall make charges, to be paid by the state or local government or governments for which it performs the service, for any audits performed by it in order to reimburse itself for the actual costs incurred in making the audit.
3. The commission may require the attendance of any person within the state where it is conducting an audit or part thereof at a time and place fixed by it within such state for the purpose of giving testimony with respect to any account, book, paper, document, other record, property or stock of merchandise being examined in connection with the audit.  If the person is not within the jurisdiction, he may be required to attend for such purpose at any time and place fixed by the commission within the state of which he is a resident:  provided that such state has adopted this article.
4. The commission may apply to any court having power to issue compulsory process for orders in aid of its powers and responsibilities pursuant to this article and any and all such courts shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders.  Failure of any person to obey any such order shall be punishable as contempt of the issuing court.  If the party or subject matter on account of which the commission seeks an order is within the jurisdiction of the court to which application is made, such application may be to a court in the state or subdivision on behalf of which the audit is being made or a court in the state in which the object of the order being sought is situated.  The provisions of this paragraph apply only to courts in a state that has adopted this article.
5. The commission may decline to perform any audit requested if it finds that its available personnel or other resources are insufficient for the purpose or that, in the terms requested, the audit is impracticable of satisfactory performance.  If the commission, on the basis of its experience, has reason to believe that an audit of a particular taxpayer, either at a particular time or on a particular schedule, would be of interest to a number of party states or their subdivisions, it may offer to make the audit or audits, the offer to be contingent on sufficient participation therein as determined by the commission.
6. Information obtained by any audit pursuant to this article shall be confidential and available only for tax purposes to party states, their subdivisions or the United States.  Availability of information shall be in accordance with the laws of the states or subdivisions on whose account the commission performs the audit, and only through the appropriate agencies or officers of such states or subdivisions.  Nothing in this article shall be construed to require any taxpayer to keep records for any period not otherwise required by law.
7. Other arrangements made or authorized pursuant to law for cooperative audit by or on behalf of the party states or any of their subdivisions are not superseded or invalidated by this article.
8. In no event shall the commission make any charge against a taxpayer for an audit.
9. As used in this article, "tax," in addition to the meaning ascribed to it in Article II, means any tax or license fee imposed in whole or in part for revenue purposes.
ARTICLE IX. ARBITRATION
1. Whenever the commission finds a need for settling disputes concerning apportionments and allocations by arbitration, it may adopt a regulation placing this article in effect, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VII.
2. The commission shall select and maintain an arbitration panel composed of officers and employees of state and local governments and private persons who shall be knowledgeable and experienced in matters of tax law and administration.
3. Whenever a taxpayer who has elected to employ Article IV, or whenever the laws of the party state or subdivision thereof are substantially identical with the relevant provisions of Article IV, the taxpayer, by written notice to the commission and to each party state or subdivision thereof that would be affected, may secure arbitration of an apportionment or allocation, if he is dissatisfied with the final administrative determination of the tax agency of the state or subdivision with respect thereto on the ground that it would subject him to double or multiple taxation by two or more party states or subdivisions thereof.  Each party state and subdivision thereof hereby consents to the arbitration as provided herein, and agrees to be bound thereby.
4. The arbitration board shall be composed of one person selected by the taxpayer, one by the agency or agencies involved, and one member of the commission's arbitration panel.  If the agencies involved are unable to agree on the person to be selected by them, such person shall be selected by lot from the total membership of the arbitration panel.  The two persons selected for the board in the manner provided by the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall jointly select the third member of the board.  If they are unable to agree on the selection, the third member shall be selected by lot from among the total membership of the arbitration panel.  No member of a board selected by lot shall be qualified to serve if he is an officer or employee or is otherwise affiliated with any party to the arbitration proceeding.  Residence within the jurisdiction of a party to the arbitration proceeding shall not constitute affiliation within the meaning of this paragraph.
5. The board may sit in any state or subdivision party to the proceeding, in the state of the taxpayer's incorporation, residence or domicile, in any state where the taxpayer does business, or in any place that it finds most appropriate for gaining access to evidence relevant to the matter before it.
6. The board shall give due notice of the times and places of its hearings.  The parties shall be entitled to be heard, to present evidence, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses.  The board shall act by majority vote.
7. The board shall have power to administer oaths, take testimony, subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents, and issue commissions to take testimony.  Subpoenas may be signed by any member of the board.  In case of failure to obey a subpoena, and upon application by the board, any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction of the state in which the board is sitting or in which the person to whom the subpoena is directed may be found may make an order requiring compliance with the subpoena, and the court may punish failure to obey the order as a contempt.  The provisions of this paragraph apply only in states that have adopted this article.
8. Unless the parties otherwise agree the expenses and other costs of the arbitration shall be assessed and allocated among the parties by the board in such manner as it may determine.  The commission shall fix a schedule of compensation for members of arbitration boards and of other allowable expenses and costs.  No officer or employee of a state or local government who serves as a member of a board shall be entitled to compensation therefor unless he is required on account of his service to forego the regular compensation attaching to his public employment, but any such board member shall be entitled to expenses.
9. The board shall determine the disputed apportionment or allocation and any matters necessary thereto.  The determinations of the board shall be final for purposes of making the apportionment or allocation, but for no other purpose.
10. The board shall file with the commission and with each tax agency represented in the proceeding:  the determination of the board;  the board's written statement of its reasons therefor;  the record of the board's proceedings;  and any other documents required by the arbitration rules of the commission to be filed.
11. The commission shall publish the determinations of boards together with the statements of the reasons therefor.
12. The commission shall adopt and publish rules of procedure and practice and shall file a copy of such rules and of any amendment thereto with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.
13. Nothing contained herein shall prevent at any time a written compromise of any matter or matters in dispute, if otherwise lawful, by the parties to the arbitration proceeding.
ARTICLE X. ENTRY INTO FORCE AND WITHDRAWAL
1. This compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any seven states.  Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof.  The commission shall arrange for notification of all party states whenever there is a new enactment of the compact.
2. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.  No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.
3. No proceeding commenced before an arbitration board prior to the withdrawal of a state and to which the withdrawing state or any subdivision thereof is a party shall be discontinued or terminated by the withdrawal, nor shall the board thereby lose jurisdiction over any of the parties to the proceeding necessary to make a binding determination therein.
ARTICLE XI. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS AND JURISDICTION
Nothing in this compact shall be construed to:
(a)  Affect the power of any state or subdivision thereof to fix rates of taxation, except that a party state shall be obligated to implement Article III 2 of this compact.
(b)  Apply to any tax or fixed fee imposed for the registration of a motor vehicle or any tax on motor fuel, other than a sales tax;  provided that the definition of "tax" in Article VIII 9 may apply for the purposes of that article and the commission's powers of study and recommendation pursuant to Article VI 3 may apply.
(c)  Withdraw or limit the jurisdiction of any state or local court or administrative officer or body with respect to any person, corporation or other entity or subject matter, except to the extent that such jurisdiction is expressly conferred by or pursuant to this compact upon another agency or body.
(d)  Supersede or limit the jurisdiction of any court of the United States.
ARTICLE XII. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.  The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.  If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

(a)  If a person purchases tangible personal property by means of a sale for resale for the purpose of renting or leasing the property for use but subsequently sells the property in an occasional sale before the person has collected and paid to the state an amount of sales tax on rental or lease charges equal to the amount of sales tax that would have been due if the person had not acquired the property at a sale for resale, the person at the time of the occasional sale shall include in his receipts from taxable sales the amount by which the purchase price of the item at the occasional sale exceeds the amount received from renting or leasing the property.
(b)  If tangible personal property is rented or leased under an agreement that provides that all or a portion of the rental or lease payments may be credited against the purchase price of the item, the lessor shall collect the sales tax on the sales price, including the sum of all lease or rental payments for the term of the lease or rental, at the time the purchaser takes possession of the property or when the first payment is due, whichever period is the earlier.  If the purchaser-lessee returns the taxable item to the seller-lessor before the end of the lease or rental period without having acquired title to the property, the seller-lessor may take a credit against other taxes due under this chapter or claim a refund as provided by this code for an amount equal to the amount of the taxes paid on the unpaid portion of the sales price.

Sec. 151.061.  SOURCING OF CHARGES FOR MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.  (a)  In this section:
(1)  "Home service provider" means the facilities-based carrier or reseller with which the customer contracts for the provision of mobile telecommunications services.
(2)  "Place of primary use" means the street address that is representative of where the customer's use of the mobile telecommunications service primarily occurs.  That location must be the residential street address or the primary business street address of the customer that is within the licensed service area of the home service provider.
(3)  "Electronic database" means a database provided by the state or by a designated database provider to home service providers.  Such electronic database shall, allowing for de minimis deviations, designate for each street address in the state, including, to the extent practical, any multiple postal street addresses applicable to one street location, the appropriate taxing jurisdictions, and the appropriate code for each taxing jurisdiction, for each level of taxing jurisdiction, identified by one nationwide numeric code.  The nationwide standard numeric codes shall contain the same number of numeric digits, with each digit or combination of digits referring to the same level of taxing jurisdiction throughout the United States using a format similar to FIPS 55-3 or other appropriate standard approved by the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission or their successors.  Each address shall be provided in standard postal format.  Such electronic database shall also provide the appropriate code for each street address with respect to political subdivisions which are not taxing jurisdictions when reasonably needed to determine the proper taxing jurisdictions.
(b)  This section applies to state and local sales and use taxes administered and computed under this title or Title 3 and to which this title or Title 3 applies, including this chapter.
(c)  The federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act (4 U.S.C. Sections 116-126) governs the sourcing of charges for mobile telecommunications services.  In accordance with that Act:
(1)  mobile telecommunications services provided in a taxing jurisdiction to a customer, the charges for which are billed by or for the customer's home service provider, shall be deemed to be provided by the customer's home service provider;  and
(2)  all charges for mobile telecommunications services that are deemed to be provided by the customer's home service provider in accordance with this Act are authorized to be subjected to tax, charge, or fee by the taxing jurisdictions whose territorial limits encompass the customer's place of primary use, regardless of where the mobile telecommunications services originate, terminate, or pass through, and no other taxing jurisdiction may impose taxes, charges, or fees on charges for such mobile telecommunications services.
(d)  If a customer believes that an amount of tax or an assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction included on a billing is erroneous, the customer shall notify the home service provider in writing.  The customer shall include in the written notification:
(1)  the customer's street address for the customer's place of primary use;
(2)  the account name and number for which the customer requests the correction;
(3)  a description of the error asserted by the customer;  and
(4)  any other information that the home service provider reasonably requires to process the request.
(e)  Not later than the 60th day after the date the home service provider receives a request under Subsection (d), the home service provider shall review the provider's records and the electronic database or enhanced zip code to determine the correct amount of the tax imposed or the assignment of the customer's place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction, as appropriate.  If the home service provider determines that the amount of tax imposed or the assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is incorrect, the home service provider shall correct the error and refund or credit any amount of tax erroneously collected from the customer.  The home service provider shall correct the error and refund or credit the amount of tax erroneously collected from the customer for a period of up to four years.  If the home service provider determines that the amount of tax imposed or the assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is correct, the home service provider shall provide a written explanation to the customer.
(f)  The procedures prescribed by Subsections (d) and (e) are the first course of remedy available to a customer requesting a correction of assignment of place of primary use or of taxing jurisdiction or a refund of or other compensation for taxes erroneously collected by the home service provider.
(g)  The state may provide an electronic database, described in Subsection (a)(3), to a home service provider or, if the state does not provide such an electronic database to home service providers, the designated database provider may provide an electronic database to a home service provider.
(h)  The state or the designated database provider that provides or maintains an electronic database described in Subsection (a)(3) shall provide notice of the availability of the then current electronic database, and any subsequent revisions thereof, by publication in the manner normally employed by the state.
(i)  A home service provider using the data contained in an electronic database described in Subsection (a)(3) shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability that otherwise would be due solely as a result of any error or omission in such database provided by the state or designated database provider.  The home service provider shall reflect changes made to such database during a calendar quarter not later than 30 days after the end of such calendar quarter.
(j)  If neither the state nor the designated database provider provides an electronic database as described in Subsection (a)(3), a home service provider shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability in the state that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an assignment of a street address to an incorrect taxing jurisdiction if, subject to Subsection (n), the home service provider employs an enhanced zip code to assign each street address to a specific taxing jurisdiction for each level of taxing jurisdiction and exercises due diligence at each level of taxing jurisdiction to ensure that each such street address is assigned to the correct taxing jurisdiction.  If an enhanced zip code overlaps boundaries of taxing jurisdictions of the same level, the home service provider must designate one specific jurisdiction within such enhanced zip code for use in taxing the activity for such enhanced zip code for each level of taxing jurisdiction.  Any enhanced zip code assignment changed in accordance with Subsection (n) is deemed to be in compliance with this section.  For purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a home service provider has exercised due diligence if such home service provider demonstrates that it has:
(1)  expended reasonable resources to implement and maintain an appropriately detailed electronic database of street address assignments to taxing jurisdictions;
(2)  implemented and maintained reasonable internal controls to promptly correct misassignments of street addresses to taxing jurisdictions;  and
(3)  used all reasonably obtainable and usable data pertaining to municipal annexations, incorporations, reorganizations, and any other changes in jurisdictional boundaries that materially affect the accuracy of such database.
(k)  Subsection (j) applies to a home service provider that is in compliance with the requirements of Subsection (j), if an electronic database as defined in Subsection (a)(3) is not provided until the later of:
(1)  18 months after the nationwide standard numeric code described in Subsection (a)(3) has been approved by the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission;  or
(2)  6 months after the state or a designated database provider in the state provides such database as prescribed in Subsection (a)(3).
(l)  A home service provider shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining the customer's place of primary use as defined in Subsection (a)(2).  Subject to Subsection (n), and if the home service provider's reliance on information provided by its customer is in good faith, a taxing jurisdiction shall:
(1)  allow a home service provider to rely on the applicable residential or business street address supplied by the home service provider's customer;  and
(2)  not hold a home service provider liable for any additional taxes, charges, or fees based on a different determination of the place of primary use for taxes, charges, or fees that are customarily passed on to the customer as a separate itemized charge.
(m)  Except as provided in Subsection (n), a taxing jurisdiction shall allow a home service provider to treat the address used by the home service provider for tax purposes for any customer under a service contract or agreement in effect two years after the date of the enactment of the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act (4 U.S.C. Sections 116-126) as that customer's place of primary use for the remaining term of such service contract or agreement, excluding any extension or renewal of such service contract or agreement, for purposes of determining the taxing jurisdictions to which taxes, charges, or fees on charges for mobile telecommunications services are remitted.
(n)  The state may:
(1)  determine that the address used for purposes of determining the taxing jurisdictions to which taxes, charges, or fees for mobile telecommunications services are remitted does not meet the definition of place of primary use under Subsection (a)(2) and give binding notice to the home service provider to change the place of primary use on a prospective basis from the date of notice of determination.  Before the state gives such notice of determination, the customer shall be given an opportunity to demonstrate in accordance with applicable state administrative procedures that the address is the customer's place of primary use;  and
(2)  determine that the assignment of a taxing jurisdiction by a home service provider under Subsection (j) does not reflect the correct taxing jurisdiction and give binding notice to the home service provider to change the assignment on a prospective basis from the date of notice of determination.  The home service provider shall be given an opportunity to demonstrate in accordance with applicable state administrative procedures that the assignment reflects the correct taxing jurisdiction.
(o)(1) If a taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise subject charges for mobile telecommunications services to taxation and if these charges are aggregated with and not separately stated from charges that are subject to taxation, then the charges for nontaxable mobile telecommunications services may be subject to taxation unless the home service provider can reasonably identify charges not subject to such tax, charge, or fee from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business.
(2)  If a taxing jurisdiction does not subject charges for mobile telecommunications services to taxation, a customer may not rely upon the nontaxability of charges for mobile telecommunications services unless the customer's home service provider separately states the charges for nontaxable mobile telecommunications services from taxable charges or the home service provider elects, after receiving a written request from the customer in the form required by the provider, to provide verifiable data based upon the home service provider's books and records that are kept in the regular course of business that reasonably identifies the nontaxable charges.

(a)(6), (7), (8), (10), (11), or (12), 
151.316
(b), or

(b).
(b)  To claim an exemption to which this section applies, a registration number issued by the comptroller must be stated on the exemption certificate provided by the purchaser of the item.
(c)  A person is eligible to apply for a registration number if the person is engaged in the production of agricultural products or timber for sale or in an agricultural aircraft operation as defined by 14 C.F.R. Section 137.3.
(d)  A person who is eligible may apply to the comptroller for a registration number.  The application must:
(1)  be on a form prescribed by the comptroller;
(2)  if applicable, state the types of crops, livestock, or other agricultural products that are produced for sale on the farm or ranch on which the applicant will use or employ the item described by Subsection (a) or state that the item will be used in relation to a timber operation or an agricultural aircraft operation as defined by 14 C.F.R. Section 137.3;
(3)  as applicable, state the name and address of the farm, ranch, timber operation, or other business owned or operated by the applicant in relation to which the applicant will use the item; and

(f)  The comptroller by rule shall establish a uniform date on which all registration numbers issued under this section must be renewed, regardless of the date on which a registration number is initially issued.  The rules must require registration numbers to be renewed every four years.

(h)  The comptroller, after written notice and a hearing, may revoke the registration number issued to a person who fails to comply with this chapter or with a rule adopted under this chapter.  A person whose registration number the comptroller proposes to revoke under this section is entitled to 20 days' written notice of the time and place of the hearing on the revocation.  The notice must state the reason the comptroller is seeking to revoke the person's registration number.  At the hearing the person must show cause why the person's registration number should not be revoked.
(i)  The comptroller shall give written notice of the revocation of a registration number under Subsection (h) to the person to whom the number was issued.  The notice may be personally served on the person or sent by mail to the person's address as shown in the comptroller's records.
(j)  If the comptroller revokes a person's registration number under Subsection (h), the comptroller may not revive the registration number unless the comptroller is satisfied that the person will comply with this chapter and the rules adopted under this chapter.  The comptroller may prescribe the terms under which a revoked registration number may be revived.
(k)  Following the revocation of a registration number by the comptroller, the person who held the registration number must, on the next transaction with each seller to whom the person previously issued a claim for exemption with a registration number, notify that seller that the person's registration number is no longer valid.  The failure of a person to notify a seller as required by this subsection is considered a failure and refusal to pay the taxes imposed by this chapter by the person required to make the notification.

151.054

(p)  A person eligible for a registration number who, at the time of purchasing, leasing, renting, or otherwise consuming an item for which the person may otherwise claim an exemption to which this section applies, has not obtained a registration number from the comptroller must pay the tax on the item to the seller at the time of the transaction.  The person may then apply for a registration number and, on receipt of the number, may apply to the comptroller for a refund of the tax paid, subject to the statute of limitations.  The comptroller by rule shall establish procedures for processing the refund requests.  Tax collected by a seller under this subsection is not tax collected in error, and Section 
111.104
 does not apply to a refund request submitted under this subsection.

Sec. 151.157.  CUSTOMS BROKERS.  (a)  A customs broker, or an authorized employee of a customs broker, licensed by the comptroller under this section may issue documentation for the purpose of showing the exemption of tangible personal property under Section 
151.307
(b)(2) only under procedures established by this section, Section 
151.1575
, and by the comptroller by rule.
(a-1)  The comptroller shall maintain a password-protected website that a customs broker, or an authorized employee of a customs broker, licensed under this section must use to prepare documentation to show the exemption of tangible personal property under Section 
151.307
(b)(2).  The comptroller shall require a customs broker or authorized employee to use the website to actually produce the documentation after providing all necessary information.  The comptroller shall use the information provided by a customs broker or authorized employee under this subsection as necessary to enforce this section and Section 
151.307
.  The comptroller may provide an alternate method to prepare documentation to show the exemption of tangible personal property under Section

(d)  The amount of the bond or security required by Subsection (b)(3) is $5,000, plus an additional $1,000 for each place of business from which the customs broker intends to issue exemption certificates. The security may be in the form of cash, a certificate of deposit, a letter of credit, or another instrument of value.
(e)  A customs broker licensed under this section shall make available to the comptroller, on or after the 15th day after the date the broker receives written notice from the comptroller, the customs broker's books and records relating to the business of issuing documentation certifying the export of tangible personal property beyond the territorial limits of the United States for purposes of exempting the property from the taxes imposed by this chapter.  The customs broker shall make available to the comptroller, without notice from the comptroller, the customs broker's books and records if the comptroller determines that the comptroller's ability to administer and enforce effectively the provisions of this chapter relating to documentation for the purpose of showing the exemption of tangible personal property under Section 
151.307
(b)(2) is jeopardized by providing notice.  The customs broker shall keep the books and records described by this subsection for at least two years after the date of the last entry that they contain.  The customs broker shall report quarterly to the comptroller:

151.1575
(c) or issues documentation that is false. The comptroller may determine the length of suspension or revocation necessary for the enforcement of this chapter and the comptroller's rules.  A proceeding to suspend or revoke a license under this subsection is a contested case under Chapter 
2001
, Government Code.  Judicial review is by trial de novo.  The district courts of Travis County have exclusive original jurisdiction of a suit under this section.
(f-1)  In addition to any other penalty provided by law, the comptroller may require a customs broker to pay to the comptroller the amount of any tax refunded and the amount of any penalty imposed under Section 
151.1575
(c) if the customs broker did not comply with this section or the rules adopted by the comptroller under this section.
(g)  A customs broker may authorize a person to act as an independent contractor to certify in accordance with Section 
151.1575
(a)(1) that tangible personal property has been exported outside of the United States only if the authorization is part of the written contract and the comptroller in writing approves the authorization.  A customs broker may not authorize a person under this subsection to prepare documentation for the purpose of showing the exemption for tangible personal property under Section 
151.307
(b)(2).

(1)  adding the amount of all invoices for merchandise sold to the seller during the preceding calendar or fiscal year to obtain the total sum of merchandise purchased;
(2)  adding the amount of all invoices for exempt merchandise sold to the seller during the preceding calendar or fiscal year to obtain the total sum of exempt merchandise purchased;
(3)  dividing the sum obtained under Subdivision (2) of this subsection by the sum obtained under Subdivision (1) of this subsection to obtain a percentage relationship;

(e)  Under procedures adopted by and with the consent of the comptroller, a seller eligible to determine its total taxable receipts under this section may add to the amount provided by Subdivision (2) of Subsection (a) of this section an additional amount that represents that portion of the amount of all invoices for merchandise sold to the seller during the preceding calendar or fiscal year that was not considered exempt merchandise for purposes of Subdivision (1) of Subsection (a) of this section but that became exempt under Section 
151.3141

Sec. 154.025.  LIEN TO SECURE PAYMENT OF TAX.  (a)  In this section, "collecting agent" means a person who pays or who is liable for payment of the tax imposed under Section 
154.022
 and who is not the consumer of the cigarettes on which the tax is imposed.
(b)  A collecting agent is an agent of the state for the purpose of collecting the cigarette tax for the state.
(c)  A collecting agent has a lien on:
(1)  cigarettes on which the collecting agent has paid or is liable for the payment of the tax imposed under Section 
154.022
;  and
(2)  the proceeds from the sale of the cigarettes.
(d)  The lien under this section attaches to all cigarettes purchased from a collecting agent and all proceeds from the sale of the cigarettes on the date that the cigarettes are sold by the collecting agent.  An action by the collecting agent or any other person is not required to perfect the lien.
(e)  The lien under this section takes priority over any other lien on the cigarettes purchased from a collecting agent and the proceeds from the sale of the cigarettes, except the preferred state tax lien under Section 
154.413
.
(f)  A collecting agent may enforce a lien under this section through any legal proceeding, including a proceeding under Title 11, U.S.C., and assertion of an administrative priority claim to the extent that the lien does not adequately protect the collecting agent.
(g)  A prior demand is not required to commence an action to enforce a lien under this section.
(h)  In an action to enforce a lien under this section, a court may prevent the resale of any cigarettes on which a collecting agent has the lien by any appropriate order, including the seizure of the cigarettes by an appropriate legal officer through attachment, sequestration, or other procedure.  It is not a defense to the granting of injunctive relief by the court that remedies at law, including a suit for damages, are available.
(i)  A court shall distribute money received from the foreclosure of a lien under this section in the following order:
(1)  payment of all costs and expenses, including attorney fees, incurred by a collecting agent to enforce the lien;
(2)  payment of taxes on the cigarettes purchased from the collecting agent and subject to the lien, including not only the taxes on the cigarettes and proceeds subject to the foreclosure but also the taxes on all cigarettes for which the collecting agent has not received payment in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the collecting agent and the person to whom the collecting agent sold the cigarettes;  and
(3)  any remaining money to the person against whom the lien operates.
(j)  A lien under this section may not be waived if the tax payment that is secured by the lien has not been paid to the collecting agent.  A purported waiver of the tax payment is void.
(k)  To the extent allowed by law, the priority claim of the comptroller under 11 U.S.C. Section 507(d) for taxes imposed by Section 
154.022
 is assigned to the collecting agent.

154.152
, each distributor shall obtain the necessary stamps before receiving or accepting delivery of unstamped packages of cigarettes.

Sec. 154.051.  CIGARETTE TAX RECOVERY TRUST FUND.  (a)  The cigarette tax recovery trust fund is a private trust fund established outside the state treasury and as provided by this section secures the payment of cigarette taxes by distributors who contribute to the fund.  The fund is composed of the total amount in the separate accounts maintained in trust for all contributing distributors as provided by this section.  The assets of the fund, including interest earned by those assets, are to be held in trust for the benefit and protection of the state treasury, and may not be diverted, distributed, or appropriated for any purpose other than as provided by this section.  Interest earned by a distributor's account but not yet refunded to the distributor pursuant to Subsection (d) shall, on a monthly basis, be paid to the comptroller as provided by Subsection (b) or credited to the distributor's account.
(b)  The comptroller is the trustee of the fund as provided by Section 
404.073
, Government Code, and shall manage the fund as provided by this section.  In investing the assets of the fund, the comptroller has the obligations, duties, and powers provided for the investment of state funds by Sections 
404.021
 through 
404.0245
, Government Code.  The comptroller shall receive five percent of the interest earned on all assets of the fund as compensation for serving as trustee of the fund.
(c)  A distributor who orders stamps from the comptroller under this chapter without advance payment shall contribute to an account maintained in the distributor's name in the fund money in the amount of each allowance to which the distributor is entitled under Section 
154.052
. When the money in the distributor's account equals 20 percent of the designated amount of stamps requested by the distributor and approved by the comptroller to be purchased in any one month, the distributor's interest in the fund becomes vested.
(d)  Except as provided by Subsection (g) of this section, on the last day of each quarter after the quarter in which a distributor's interest in the fund becomes vested, the comptroller shall refund to the distributor all money contributed to the fund by the distributor under Subsection (c) of this section in the earliest preceding quarter for which a refund has not been paid, plus interest earned on that amount, as long as the distributor's interest in the fund remains vested.
(e)  Until a distributor who orders stamps without advance payment acquires a vested interest in the fund, the comptroller may require the distributor to post with the comptroller an irrevocable letter of credit drawn in the form and amount specified by the comptroller to secure the payment of cigarette taxes by that distributor.  The comptroller may not ship stamps to a distributor not having a vested interest in the fund without advance payment until the distributor posts the required letter of credit.
(f)  In addition to any other requirement under this section, the comptroller as a condition for shipping stamps without advance payment may:
(1)  require a fiscal-year-end financial statement, including a balance sheet and income statement verifiable as to its accuracy or other financial information acceptable to the comptroller and verifiable as to its accuracy;
(2)  require indemnification from each officer, director, and stockholder owning 10 percent or more of outstanding stock, if the distributor is a corporation, from each partner, if the distributor is a partnership, from each member or owner of a joint venture or syndication, and from the owner of a sole proprietorship;
(3)  require the distributor to obtain and provide the comptroller with a credit report from a credit reporting agency acceptable to the comptroller;
(4)  require a distributor to increase the balance in its account in the fund;
(5)  require a distributor to post a letter of credit;
(6)  reduce a distributor's credit time or amount;  or
(7)  take any other reasonable and necessary action to protect the state treasury from loss due to the nonpayment of cigarette taxes.
(g)  If a distributor who has an account in the fund fails to pay in full a tax imposed by this chapter by the due date, the comptroller, without prior notice to the distributor or any other preliminary procedure, may seize any unaffixed stamps and any stamped cigarette packages, up to and including the full amount of unpaid tax.  If the proceeds from the seizure do not satisfy the total tax deficiency or the comptroller does not seize any unaffixed stamps or stamped cigarette packages, the comptroller may withdraw immediately from the fund an amount equal to the amount of unpaid taxes due.  The comptroller shall first withdraw the amount from the account of the defaulting distributor.  The comptroller shall use the comptroller's best efforts to collect the tax due from the defaulting distributor before withdrawing money from the other accounts in the fund to satisfy the tax liability.  If that distributor's account does not contain sufficient money to satisfy the tax liability in full, the comptroller shall withdraw the additional amount necessary to satisfy that liability from the other accounts in the fund in proportion to the balance of each account, except that the withdrawal from any other distributor's account in the fund is limited to an amount not greater than 50 percent of the designated amount of stamps requested by the distributor under Subsection (c) or of the amount required by the comptroller under Subsection (f)(4).  Not later than the fifth day after the date of a withdrawal, the comptroller shall notify each distributor of the withdrawal from its account and the amount withdrawn.  If as a result of a withdrawal made under this subsection a distributor's balance in its account is reduced to an amount less than the minimum required under this section, the distributor's interest in the fund is no longer vested, and the comptroller may discontinue refunds to the distributor under Subsection (d) until the distributor again acquires a vested interest in the fund.  The comptroller may require a distributor whose interest in the fund is no longer vested to post an irrevocable letter of credit with the comptroller to secure the payment of cigarette taxes by the distributor.  To protect the fund, each distributor having an account in the fund must indemnify the fund against any amount withdrawn from the fund under this subsection because of the failure of the distributor to pay in full a tax imposed by this chapter by the due date.
(h)  If distributor accounts, other than a defaulting distributor account, are drawn pursuant to Subsection (g), each affected, nondefaulting distributor shall have a claim against the defaulting distributor for the amount so drawn.  The comptroller is hereby appointed trustee, agent, and assignee of each affected, nondefaulting distributor for purposes of seeking recovery of the amount so drawn.  The comptroller shall have the sole judgment and discretion in deciding whether or not to pursue such a claim and shall have discretion to handle any such claim on any basis that in the opinion of the comptroller is in the best interest of the fund.  The comptroller is released from any liability related to the handling of the claims described in this section except for intentional or wilful misconduct.
(i)  A distributor or person authorized to act on behalf of a distributor may notify the comptroller in writing that the distributor no longer desires to have stamps shipped or a meter set without advance payment, and may request that the money in the distributor's account in the fund be paid to the distributor or the distributor's heirs or assigns.  The comptroller shall pay the money in the distributor's account as requested at the end of the next quarter after all outstanding taxes owed to the state by the distributor have been paid.
(j)  Under no circumstances shall the comptroller return to any distributor an amount greater than the balance in the distributor's account within the cigarette tax recovery trust fund less any sums drawn pursuant to Subsection (g). The State of Texas' liability to any distributor pursuant to this section is expressly limited to the sums on deposit in the distributor's account at the time the request for return of funds is made.
(k)  The comptroller may adopt and enforce rules necessary to carry out this section.
(l)  For purposes of this section, "quarter" refers to a quarter of the state's fiscal year.
(m)  Information provided under Subsection (f) is confidential and not subject to Chapter 
552
, Government Code.
(n)  The comptroller shall regularly distribute financial information regarding the performance of the fund to participating distributors on a regular basis.  On the written request of a participating distributor, the comptroller shall provide the distributor with the name and address of each distributor participating in the fund, the percentage of the total fund represented by each distributor's account, and the total amount of money in the fund.
(o)  In lieu of participation in the cigarette tax recovery trust fund to secure payment for stamps and in lieu of advance payment for stamps, a distributor may pledge to the comptroller sufficient collateral to secure payment for stamps. Such pledge shall be evidenced by a pledge agreement in a form promulgated by the comptroller, and such collateral shall consist of certificates of deposit, treasury notes, treasury bills, or other similar types of collateral acceptable to the comptroller and held in a separate trust fund established in the Texas Treasury Safekeeping Trust Company.  All interest earned on such collateral shall belong to the distributor.  The comptroller may require the pledge of additional collateral in the event the comptroller determines that the fair market value of the pledged collateral is less than the amount due the comptroller for stamps. On the written request of the distributor, the comptroller shall release collateral from the pledge agreement or allow the substitution of collateral subject to the pledge agreement if after such release or substitution the fair market value of the collateral subject to the pledge will be equal to or greater than the amount due the comptroller for stamps. If a distributor fails to pay tax in full when due, the comptroller may, if the distributor does not pay such past due tax and any penalty related thereto within three days after receipt of written notice of such failure from the comptroller, sell or dispose of the collateral and apply the proceeds to the payment of taxes, interest, penalties, and costs due to the comptroller by the distributor, with any remaining proceeds being refunded to the distributor.

(a)  The comptroller may enter into a cooperative agreement with another state for the collection of motor fuel taxes, the exchange of information, the auditing of users of motor fuel used in fleets of motor vehicles operated or intended for interstate operation, and the auditing of importers and exporters.  An agreement or amendment of an agreement takes effect according to its terms, except that an agreement or amendment may not take effect until the proposed agreement or amendment is published in the Texas Register.
(b)  An agreement may provide for:
(1)  determining the base state for motor fuel users;
(2)  user, importer, and exporter records requirements;
(3)  audit procedures;
(4)  exchange of information;
(5)  persons eligible for tax licensing;
(6)  licensing and license revocation procedures, permits, penalties, and fees;
(7)  defining qualified motor vehicles;
(8)  determining bonding procedures, types, and amounts;
(9)  specifying reporting requirements and periods;
(10)  defining refund procedures and limitations, including the payment of interest;
(11)  defining uniform penalties, fees, and interest rates;
(12)  determining methods for collecting motor fuel taxes and for collecting and forwarding motor fuel taxes, other than penalties, due to another jurisdiction;
(13)  the temporary remittal of funds equal to the amount of the taxes and interest due to another jurisdiction but not otherwise collected, subject to appropriation of funds for that purpose;  and
(14)  other provisions to facilitate the administration of the agreement.
(c)  The comptroller may, as required by the terms of an agreement, forward to an officer of another state any information in the comptroller's possession relating to the manufacture, receipts, sale, use, transportation, or shipment of motor fuel by any person.  The comptroller may disclose to an officer of another state the location of officers, motor vehicles, and other real and personal property of users, importers, and exporters of motor fuel.
(d)  An agreement may provide for each state to audit the records of a person based in this state to determine if the motor fuel taxes due each state that is a party to the agreement are properly reported and paid.  An agreement may provide for each state to forward the findings of an audit performed on a person based in this state to each other state in which the person has taxable use of motor fuel, from which the person imports motor fuel into this state, or to which the person exports motor fuel from this state.  For a person who is not based in this state and who has taxable use of motor fuel in this state or an import into or export out of this state, the comptroller may use an audit performed by another state that is a party to an agreement with this state to make an assessment of motor fuel taxes against the person.
(e)  An agreement entered into under this section does not affect the authority of the comptroller to audit any person under any other law.
(f)  An agreement entered into under this section prevails over an inconsistent rule of the comptroller.  Except as otherwise provided by this section, a statute of this state prevails over an inconsistent provision of an agreement entered into under this section.
(g)  The comptroller may segregate in a separate fund or account the amount of motor fuel taxes, other than penalties, estimated to be due to other jurisdictions, motor fuel taxes subject to refund during the fiscal year, licensing fees, and other costs collected under the agreement.  On a determination of an amount held that is due to be remitted to another jurisdiction, the comptroller may issue a warrant or make an electronic transfer of the amount as necessary to carry out the purposes of the agreement.  An auditing cost, membership fee, and other cost associated with the agreement may be paid from interest earned on funds segregated under this subsection.  Any interest earnings in excess of the costs associated with the agreement shall be credited to general revenue.
(h)  The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to enter into motor fuel tax agreements with other jurisdictions that may provide for the temporary remittal of amounts due other jurisdictions that exceed the amounts collected and for cooperation with other jurisdictions for the collection of taxes imposed by this state and other jurisdictions on motor fuel that is imported into or exported out of this state.  The comptroller shall ensure that reasonable measures are developed to recover motor fuel taxes and other amounts due this state during each biennium.
(i)  The comptroller shall attempt to enter into a cooperative agreement with each state that borders this state to provide for the collection of taxes imposed by this state and the bordering state on motor fuel that is imported into this state from or exported from this state to the bordering state.  The comptroller is encouraged to attempt to enter into similar cooperative agreements with states that do not border this state.

(6)  a description of the product being transported.
(c)  In the event of an extraordinary circumstance, including an act of God, that temporarily interferes with the ability to issue an automated machine-generated shipping document, a manually prepared shipping document that contains all of the information required by Subsection (b) shall be substituted for the machine-generated shipping document.
(d)  A terminal operator or bulk plant operator may rely on the representation made by the purchaser of motor fuel or the purchaser's agent concerning the destination state of the motor fuel.  A purchaser is liable for any tax due as a result of the purchaser's diversion of motor fuel from the represented destination state.
(e)  A person to whom a shipping document was issued shall:
(1)  carry the shipping document in the barge, vessel, railroad tank car, or other transport vehicle for which the document was issued when transporting the motor fuel described in the document;
(2)  show the shipping document on request to any law enforcement officer, representative of the comptroller, or other authorized individual, when transporting the motor fuel described;
(3)  deliver the motor fuel to the destination state printed on the shipping document unless the person:
(A)  notifies the comptroller and the destination state, if a diversion program is in place, before transporting the motor fuel into a state other than the printed destination state, that the person has received instructions after the shipping document was issued to deliver the motor fuel to a different destination state;
(B)  receives from the comptroller and destination state, if a diversion program is in place, a diversion number authorizing the diversion;  and
(C)  writes on the shipping document the change in destination state and the diversion number;  and
(4)  give a copy of the shipping document to the person to whom the motor fuel is delivered.
(f)  The purchaser is responsible for paying the applicable destination state taxes along with filing a refund with the origin state.  The supplier may not refund any taxes due to the diversion of a product.
(g)  The person to whom motor fuel is delivered by barge, vessel, railroad tank car, or transport vehicle may not accept delivery of the motor fuel if the destination state shown on the shipping document for the motor fuel is a state other than this state, except that the person may accept that delivery if the document contains a diversion number authorized by the comptroller and destination state, if applicable.  The person to whom the motor fuel is delivered shall examine the shipping document to determine that the destination state is this state, and shall retain a copy of the shipping document at the delivery location or another place until the fourth anniversary of the date of delivery.
(h)  This section does not apply to motor fuel that is delivered into the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle.

The license holder shall within five days make a report covering the period not covered by preceding reports filed by the license holder and ending with the date of cancellation, and shall remit and pay to the comptroller all taxes that have been collected and that have accrued from the sale, use, or distribution of motor fuel in this state.
(e)  The comptroller may revoke a license if the license holder purchases for export motor fuel on which the tax was not paid under this chapter and subsequently diverts or causes the motor fuel to be diverted to a destination in this state or to any destination other than the originally designated state or country without first obtaining a diversion number.

(a)  The comptroller may suspend a person's license without notice or a hearing for the person's failure to comply with this chapter or a rule adopted under this chapter if the person's continued operation constitutes an immediate and substantial threat to the collection of taxes imposed by this chapter and attributable to the person's operation.
(b)  If the comptroller summarily suspends a person's license, proceedings for a preliminary hearing before the comptroller or the comptroller's representative must be initiated simultaneously with the summary suspension.

Sec. 162.010.  IMPOUNDMENT AND SEIZURE.  (a)  If after examination or other investigation, the comptroller believes that the owner or operator of a motor vehicle or cargo tank, or a person receiving, possessing, delivering, or selling gasoline or diesel fuel, has not paid all motor fuel taxes due, or does not have a valid license entitling that person to possess or transport tax-free motor fuel, the comptroller or peace officer may impound the fuel, the motor vehicle, cargo tank, storage tank, equipment, paraphernalia, or other tangible personal property used for or incident to the storage, sale, or transportation of that motor fuel.  Unless proof is produced within three working days after the beginning of impoundment that the owner, operator, or other person has paid the taxes established by the comptroller to be due on the gasoline or diesel fuel stored, sold, used, or transported and any other taxes due to this state, or that the owner, operator, or other person holds a valid license to possess or transport tax-free motor fuel, the comptroller may demand payment of all taxes, penalties, and interest due to this state, and all costs of impoundment.

Sec. 162.011.  SALE OF SEIZED PROPERTY.  (a)  The comptroller may sell property seized under Section 
162.010

(b)  Notice of the time and place of a sale shall be given to the delinquent person in writing by certified mail at least 20 days before the date set for the sale.  The notice shall be enclosed in an envelope addressed to the person at the person's last known address or place of business.  It shall be deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid.  The notice shall also be published once a week for two consecutive weeks before the date of the sale in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the property seized is to be sold.  If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the county, notice shall be posted in three public places in the county 14 days before the date set for the sale.  The notice must contain a description of the property to be sold, a statement of the amount due, including interest, penalties, and costs, the name of the delinquent, and the further statement that unless the amount due, interest, penalties, and costs are paid on or before the time fixed in the notice for the sale, the property, or as much of it as may be necessary, will be sold at public auction in accordance with the law and the notice.
(c)  At the sale, the comptroller shall sell the property and shall deliver to the purchaser a bill of sale for personal property and a deed for real property sold.  The bill of sale or deed vests the interest or title of the person liable for the amount in the purchaser.  The unsold portion of any property seized may be left at the place of sale at the risk of the person liable for the amount.
(d)  The proceeds of a sale shall be allocated according to the following priorities:

(2)  the payment of the tax, penalty, and interest;  and
(3)  the repayment of the remaining balance to the person liable for the amount unless a claim is presented before the sale by any other person who has an ownership interest evidenced by a financing statement or lien, in which case the comptroller shall withhold the remaining balance pending a determination of the rights of the respective parties.

Sec. 162.012.  PRESUMPTIONS.  (a)  A person licensed under this chapter or required to be licensed under this chapter, or other user, who fails to keep a record, issue an invoice, or file a return or report required by this chapter is presumed to have sold or used for taxable purposes all motor fuel shown by an audit by the comptroller to have been sold to the license holder or other user.  Motor fuel unaccounted for is presumed to have been sold or used for taxable purposes.  If an exporter claims an exemption under Section 
162.104
(a)(4) or 
162.204
(a)(4) and fails to report subsequent tax-free sales in this state of the motor fuel for which the exemption was claimed as required by Section 
162.1155
 or 
162.2165
, or to produce proof of payment of tax to the destination state or proof that the transaction was exempt in the destination state, the exporter is presumed to have not paid the destination state's tax or this state's tax on the motor fuel and the comptroller shall assess the tax imposed by this chapter on the motor fuel against the exporter.  The comptroller may fix or establish the amount of taxes, penalties, and interest due this state from the records of deliveries or from any records or information available.  If a tax claim, as developed from this procedure, is not paid, after the opportunity to request a redetermination, the claim and any audit made by the comptroller or any report filed by the license holder or other user is evidence in any suit or judicial proceedings filed by the attorney general and is prima facie evidence of the correctness of the claim or audit.  A prima facie presumption of the correctness of the claim may be overcome at the trial by evidence adduced by the license holder or other user.
(b)  In the absence of records showing the number of miles actually operated per gallon of motor fuel consumed, it is presumed that not less than one gallon of motor fuel was consumed for every four miles traveled.  An interstate trucker may produce evidence of motor fuel consumption to establish another mileage factor.  If an examination or audit made by the comptroller from the records of an interstate trucker shows that a greater amount of motor fuel was consumed than was reported by the interstate trucker for tax purposes, the interstate trucker is liable for the tax, penalties, and interest on the additional amount shown or the trucker is entitled to a credit or refund on overpayments of tax established by the audit.

(b)  On the effective date of a reduction of the rates of taxes imposed by this chapter, a distributor or dealer that possesses for the purpose of sale 2,000 or more gallons of gasoline or diesel fuel at each business location on which the taxes imposed by this chapter at the previous rate have been paid becomes entitled to a refund in an amount equal to the difference in the amount of taxes paid on that gasoline or diesel fuel at the previous rate and at the rate in effect on the effective date of the reduction in the tax rates.  The rules of the comptroller shall provide for the method of claiming a refund under this chapter and may require that the refund for the dealer be paid through the distributor or supplier from whom the dealer received the fuel.

Sec. 162.111.  BOND AND OTHER SECURITY FOR TAXES.  (a)  The comptroller shall determine the amount of security required of a supplier, permissive supplier, distributor, exporter, importer, or blender, taking into consideration the amount of tax that has or is expected to become due from the person, any past history of the person as a license holder under this chapter or its predecessor, and the necessity to protect this state against the failure to pay the tax as the tax becomes due.
(b)  If it is determined that the posting of security is necessary to protect this state, the comptroller may require a license holder to post a bond.  A license holder shall post a bond equal to two times the maximum amount of tax that could accrue on tax-free gasoline purchased or acquired during a reporting period.  The minimum bond is $30,000. The maximum bond is $600,000 unless the comptroller believes there is undue risk of loss of tax revenues, in which event the comptroller may require one or more bonds or securities in a total amount exceeding $600,000.

(d)  A bond must be a continuing instrument, must constitute a new and separate obligation in the penal sum named in the bond for each calendar year or portion of a year while the bond is in force, and must remain in effect until the surety on the bond is released and discharged.
(e)  Instead of filing a surety bond, an applicant for a license may substitute the following security:
(1)  cash in the form of United States currency in an amount equal to the required bond to be deposited in the suspense account of the state treasury;
(2)  an assignment to the comptroller of a certificate of deposit in any bank or savings and loan association in this state that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in an amount at least equal to the bond amount required;  or
(3)  an irrevocable letter of credit to the comptroller from any bank or savings and loan association in this state that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in an amount of credit at least equal to the bond amount required.
(f)  If the amount of an existing bond becomes insufficient or a security becomes unsatisfactory or unacceptable, the comptroller may require the filing of a new or of an additional bond or security.
(g)  A surety bond or other form of security may not be released until it is determined by examination or audit that a tax, penalty, or interest liability does not exist.  The cash or securities shall be released within 60 days after the comptroller determines that liability does not exist.
(h)  The comptroller may use the cash or certificate of deposit security to satisfy a final determination of delinquent liability or a judgment secured in any action by this state to recover gasoline taxes, costs, penalties, and interest found to be due to this state by a person in whose behalf the cash or certificate security was deposited.
(i)  A surety on a bond furnished by a license holder shall be released and discharged from liability to this state accruing on the bond on the 31st day after the date on which the surety files with the comptroller a written request to be released and discharged.  The request does not relieve, release, or discharge the surety from a liability that already accrued or that accrues before the expiration of the 30-day period.  The comptroller, promptly on receipt of the request, shall notify the license holder who furnished the bond, and unless the license holder, before the expiration date of the existing security, files with the comptroller a new bond with a surety company duly authorized to do business under the laws of this state, or other authorized security, in the amount required by this section, the comptroller shall cancel the license in the manner provided by this chapter.
(j)  The comptroller shall notify immediately the issuer of a letter of credit of a final determination of the license holder's delinquent liability or a judgment secured in any action by this state to recover gasoline taxes, costs, penalties, and interest found to be due this state by a license holder in whose behalf the letter of credit was issued.  The letter of credit allowed as security for the remittance of taxes under this subchapter shall contain a statement that the issuer agrees to respond to the comptroller's notice of liability with amounts to satisfy the comptroller's delinquency claim against the license holder.
(k)  A license holder may request an examination or audit to obtain release of the security when the license holder relinquishes the license or when the license holder wants to substitute one form of security for an existing one.

(e)  A person who files a claim for a tax refund on gasoline used for a purpose for which a tax refund is not authorized or who files an invoice supporting a refund claim on which the date, figures, or any material information has been falsified or altered forfeits the person's right to the entire amount of the refund claim filed unless the claimant provides proof satisfactory to the comptroller that the incorrect refund claim filed was due to a clerical or mathematical calculation error.
(f)  After examination of the refund claim, the comptroller, before issuing a refund warrant, shall deduct from the amount of the refund the two percent deducted originally by the license holder on the first sale or distribution of the gasoline.

(2)  25,000 gallons of dyed diesel fuel if the purchaser stipulates in the signed statement that all of the fuel will be consumed by the purchaser in the original production of, or to increase the production of, oil or gas and furnishes the licensed supplier or distributor with a letter of exception issued by the comptroller; or
(3)  25,000 gallons of dyed diesel fuel if the purchaser stipulates in the signed statement that all of the fuel will be consumed by the purchaser in agricultural off-highway equipment.
(c-1)  The monthly limitations prescribed by Subsection (c) apply regardless of whether the dyed diesel fuel is purchased in a single transaction during that month or in multiple transactions during that month.
(d)  Any gallons purchased or sold in excess of the limitations prescribed by Subsection (c) constitute a taxable purchase or sale.   A purchaser that exceeds the limitations prescribed by Subsection (c) shall be required to obtain a dyed diesel fuel bonded user license.
(e)  The signed statement and end user number from the purchaser relieves the licensed supplier or distributor from the burden of proof that the sale of dyed diesel fuel for a nonhighway purpose was not taxable to the purchaser and remains in effect unless:
(1)  the statement is revoked in writing by the purchaser or licensed supplier or distributor;
(2)  the comptroller notifies the licensed supplier or distributor in writing that the purchaser may no longer make tax-free purchases;  or
(3)  the licensed supplier or distributor is put on notice by making taxable sales of dyed diesel fuel to a purchaser who has previously furnished a signed statement to the licensed supplier or distributor.
(f)  For purposes of Subsection (e)(3), a licensed supplier or distributor is not put on notice when taxable sales of dyed diesel fuel are made in accordance with Subsection (d).
(g)  The statement must be signed by the purchaser or the purchaser's representative.
(g-1)  For purposes of this section, the purchaser is considered to have temporarily furnished the signed statement to the licensed supplier or distributor if the supplier or distributor verifies that the purchaser has an end user number issued by the comptroller.  The licensed supplier or distributor shall use the comptroller's Internet website or other materials provided or produced by the comptroller to verify this information until the purchaser provides to the supplier or distributor a completed signed statement.
(h)  The comptroller by rule may allow separate operating divisions of a corporation to give separate signed statements as if the divisions were different legal entities.
(i)  The comptroller may adopt necessary forms and rules to administer and enforce this section.
(j)  A taxable use of any part of the dyed diesel fuel purchased under a signed statement shall, in addition to application of any criminal penalty, forfeit the right of the person to purchase dyed diesel fuel tax-free for a period of one year from the date of the offense.  Any tax, interest, and penalty found to be due through false or erroneous execution or continuance of a promissory statement by the purchaser, if assessed to the licensed supplier or distributor, is a debt of the purchaser to the licensed supplier or distributor until paid and is recoverable at law in the same manner as the purchase price of the fuel. 
(k)  Properly completed signed statements should be in the possession of the licensed supplier or distributor at the time the sale of dyed diesel fuel occurs.  If the licensed supplier or distributor is not in possession of the signed statements within 60 days after the date written notice requiring possession of them is given to the licensed supplier or distributor by the comptroller, exempt sales claimed by the licensed supplier or distributor that require delivery of the signed statements shall be disallowed.  If the licensed supplier or distributor delivers the signed statements to the comptroller within the 60-day period, the comptroller may verify the reason or basis for the signed statements before allowing the exempt sales.  An exempt sale may not be granted on the basis of signed statements delivered to the comptroller after the 60-day period.
(l)  On receipt of notice transmitted by an electronic means of a final judgment entered by a court against a purchaser of dyed diesel fuel for failure to pay an amount owed to a licensed supplier or distributor for the purchase of dyed diesel fuel, the comptroller shall revoke the end user number issued to the purchaser.  The comptroller shall provide the notice described by Subsection (e)(2) to the licensed supplier or distributor if the purchaser's end user number is revoked.
(m)  The comptroller may reinstate an end user number that is revoked under Subsection (l) on receipt of proof transmitted by an electronic means and satisfactory to the comptroller that the purchaser whose end user number was revoked has satisfied the judgment described by Subsection (l), including all costs and other amounts awarded in the judgment.

Sec. 162.212.  BOND AND OTHER SECURITY FOR TAXES.  (a)  The comptroller shall determine the amount of security required of a supplier, permissive supplier, distributor, exporter, importer, blender, or dyed diesel fuel bonded user, taking into consideration the amount of tax that has or is expected to become due from the person, any past history of the person as a license holder under this chapter and its predecessor, and the necessity to protect this state against the failure to pay the tax as the tax becomes due. 
(b)  If it is determined that the posting of security is necessary to protect this state, the comptroller may require a license holder to post a bond.  A license holder shall post a bond equal to two times the maximum amount of tax that could accrue on tax-free diesel fuel purchased or acquired during a reporting period.  The minimum bond is $30,000, except that for a dyed diesel fuel bonded user the minimum bond is $10,000. The maximum bond is $600,000 unless the comptroller believes there is undue risk of loss of tax revenues, in which event the comptroller may require one or more bonds or securities in a total amount exceeding $600,000.
(c)  A license holder who has filed a bond or other security under this subchapter is entitled, on request, to have the comptroller return, refund, or release the bond or security if in the judgment of the comptroller the person has for four consecutive years continuously complied with the conditions of the bond or other security filed under this subchapter.  However, if the comptroller determines that the revenues of this state would be jeopardized by the return, refund, or release of the bond or security, the comptroller may elect not to return, refund, or release the bond or security and may reimpose a requirement of a bond or other security as the comptroller determines necessary to protect the revenues of this state.
(d)  A bond must be a continuing instrument, must constitute a new and separate obligation in the penal sum named in the bond for each calendar year or portion of a year while the bond is in force, and must remain in effect until the surety on the bond is released and discharged.
(e)  Instead of filing a surety bond, an applicant for a license may substitute the following security:
(1)  cash in the form of United States currency in an amount equal to the required bond to be deposited in the suspense account of the state treasury;
(2)  an assignment to the comptroller of a certificate of deposit in any bank or savings and loan association in this state that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in an amount at least equal to the bond amount required;  or
(3)  an irrevocable letter of credit to the comptroller from any bank or savings and loan association in this state that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in an amount of credit at least equal to the bond amount required.
(f)  If the amount of an existing bond becomes insufficient or a security becomes unsatisfactory or unacceptable, the comptroller may require the filing of a new or additional bond or security.
(g)  A surety bond or other form of security may not be released until it is determined by examination or audit that a tax, penalty, or interest liability does not exist.  The cash or securities shall be released within 60 days after the comptroller determines that liability does not exist.
(h)  The comptroller may use the cash or certificate of deposit security to satisfy a final determination of delinquent liability or a judgment secured in any action by this state to recover diesel fuel taxes, costs, penalties, and interest found to be due to this state by a person in whose behalf the cash or certificate security was deposited.
(i)  A surety on a bond furnished by a license holder shall be released and discharged from liability to this state accruing on the bond on the 31st day after the date the surety files with the comptroller a written request to be released and discharged.  The request does not relieve, release, or discharge the surety from a liability already accrued, or that accrues before the expiration of the 30-day period.  The comptroller, promptly on receipt of the request, shall notify the license holder who furnished the bond, and unless the license holder, before the expiration date of the existing security, files with the comptroller a new bond with a surety company duly authorized to do business under the laws of this state, or other authorized security, in the amount required in this section, the comptroller shall cancel the license in the manner provided by this chapter.
(j)  The comptroller shall notify immediately the issuer of a letter of credit of a final determination of the license holder's delinquent liability or a judgment secured in any action by this state to recover diesel fuel taxes, costs, penalties, and interest found to be due this state by a license holder in whose behalf the letter of credit was issued.  The letter of credit allowed as security for the remittance of taxes under this subchapter shall contain a statement that the issuer agrees to respond to the comptroller's notice of liability with amounts to satisfy the comptroller's delinquency claim against the license holder.
(k)  A license holder may request an examination or audit to obtain release of the security when the license holder relinquishes the license or when the license holder wants to substitute one form of security for an existing one.

A supplemental list of additions and deletions shall be made available to the license holders each month.  A current and effective license or the list furnished by the comptroller is evidence of the validity of the license until the comptroller notifies license holders of a change in the status of a license holder.
(b)  A licensed supplier or permissive supplier who sells diesel fuel tax-free to a supplier, permissive supplier, or aviation fuel dealer whose license has been canceled or revoked under this chapter, or who sells dyed diesel fuel to a distributor or dyed diesel fuel bonded user whose license has been canceled or revoked under this chapter, is liable for any tax due on diesel fuel sold after receiving notice of the cancellation or revocation.
(c)  The comptroller shall notify all license holders under this chapter when a canceled or revoked license is subsequently reinstated and include in the notice the effective date of the reinstatement.

(c)  If the supplier or permissive supplier cannot secure from the licensed distributor or licensed importer payment of taxes due for diesel fuel removed from the terminal during the previous reporting period and the supplier elects to take a credit against a subsequent payment of diesel fuel tax to this state for the taxes not remitted to the supplier or permissive supplier by the licensed distributor or licensed importer, the supplier or permissive supplier shall notify the comptroller of the licensed distributor's or licensed importer's failure to remit tax in conjunction with the report requesting a credit.
(d)  The supplier or permissive supplier, after requesting a credit under this section, shall terminate the ability of the licensed distributor or licensed importer to defer the payment of diesel fuel tax.  The supplier or permissive supplier may not reinstate the right of the licensed distributor or licensed importer to defer the payment of diesel fuel tax until the first anniversary of the date the supplier or permissive supplier requested the credit, subject to Subsection (d-1).
(d-1)  A supplier or permissive supplier may reinstate the right of a licensed distributor or licensed importer to defer the payment of diesel fuel tax before the date prescribed by Subsection (d) if the comptroller determines that:
(1)  the supplier or permissive supplier erroneously requested the credit that resulted in the termination of the licensed distributor's or licensed importer's right to defer payment; or
(2)  the licensed distributor or licensed importer failed to pay diesel fuel taxes due because of circumstances that may have been outside the distributor's or importer's control.
(e)  A licensed distributor or licensed importer who makes timely payments of the diesel fuel tax imposed under this subchapter is entitled to retain an amount equal to 1.75 percent of the total taxes to be paid to the supplier or permissive supplier to cover administrative expenses.

Sec. 162.361.  BOND AND OTHER SECURITY FOR TAXES.  (a)  The comptroller shall determine the amount of security required of a dealer, taking into consideration the amount of tax that has or is expected to become due from the person, any past history of the person as a license holder under this chapter or its predecessor, and the necessity to protect this state against the failure to pay the tax as the tax becomes due.
(b)  The comptroller may require a license holder to post a bond if the comptroller determines it is necessary for the license holder to post security to protect the revenues of this state.  A license holder must post a bond equal to two times the maximum amount of tax that could accrue on compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas produced, purchased, acquired, sold, or delivered during a reporting period.  The minimum bond for a person described by Section 
162.357

162.357
(b) or (c) who is not described by Section

(c)  A license holder who has filed a bond or other security under this subchapter is entitled, on request, to have the comptroller return, refund, or release the bond or security if in the judgment of the comptroller the person has for four consecutive years continuously complied with the conditions of the bond or other security filed under this subchapter.  However, if the comptroller determines that the revenues of this state would be jeopardized by the return, refund, or release of the bond or security, the comptroller may elect not to return, refund, or release the bond or security and may reimpose a requirement of a bond or other security as the comptroller determines necessary to protect the revenues of this state.
(d)  A bond must be a continuing instrument, must constitute a new and separate obligation in the penal sum named in the bond for each calendar year or portion of a year while the bond is in force, and must remain in effect until the surety on the bond is released and discharged.
(e)  Instead of filing a surety bond, an applicant for a license may substitute the following security:
(1)  cash in the form of United States currency in an amount equal to the required bond to be deposited in a suspense account of the state treasury;
(2)  an assignment to the comptroller of a certificate of deposit in any bank or savings and loan association in this state that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in an amount at least equal to the bond amount required; or
(3)  an irrevocable letter of credit to the comptroller from any bank or savings and loan association in this state that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in an amount of credit at least equal to the bond amount required.
(f)  If the amount of an existing bond becomes insufficient or a security becomes unsatisfactory or unacceptable, the comptroller may require the license holder to file a new or an additional bond or security.
(g)  A surety bond or other form of security may not be released until the comptroller determines by examination or audit that a tax, penalty, or interest liability does not exist.  The comptroller shall release the cash or securities not later than the 60th day after the date the comptroller determines that liability does not exist.
(h)  The comptroller may use the cash or certificate of deposit security to satisfy a final determination of delinquent liability or a judgment secured in any action by this state to recover compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas taxes, costs, penalties, and interest found to be due to this state by a person on whose behalf the cash or certificate of deposit security was deposited.
(i)  The comptroller shall release and discharge from liability to this state a surety on a bond furnished by a license holder on the 31st day after the date on which the surety files with the comptroller a written request to be released and discharged.  The request does not relieve, release, or discharge the surety from a liability that already accrued or that accrues before the expiration of the 30-day period.  The comptroller, promptly on receipt of the request, shall notify the license holder who furnished the bond, and unless the license holder, before the expiration date of the existing security, files with the comptroller a new bond with a surety company authorized to do business under the laws of this state, or other authorized security, in the amount required by this section, the comptroller shall cancel the license in the manner provided by this chapter.
(j)  The comptroller shall immediately notify the issuer of a letter of credit of a final determination of the license holder's delinquent liability or a judgment secured in any action by this state to recover compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas taxes, costs, penalties, and interest found to be due this state by a license holder on whose behalf the letter of credit was issued.  The letter of credit allowed as security under this section must contain a statement that the issuer agrees to respond to the comptroller's notice of liability with amounts to satisfy the comptroller's delinquency claim against the license holder.
(k)  A license holder may request an examination or audit to obtain release of the security when the license holder relinquishes the license or when the license holder wants to substitute one form of security for an existing one.

(A)  "undocumented worker" means a person who is not lawfully entitled to be present and employed in the United States; and
(B)  "goods" includes the husbandry of animals, the growing and harvesting of crops, and the severance of timber from realty.
(f)  A taxable entity may subtract as a cost of goods sold indirect or administrative overhead costs, including all mixed service costs, such as security services, legal services, data processing services, accounting services, personnel operations, and general financial planning and financial management costs, that it can demonstrate are allocable to the acquisition or production of goods, except that the amount subtracted may not exceed four percent of the taxable entity's total indirect or administrative overhead costs, including all mixed service costs.  Any costs excluded under Subsection (e) may not be subtracted under this subsection.
(g)  A taxable entity that is allowed a subtraction by this section for a cost of goods sold and that is subject to Section 263A, 460, or 471, Internal Revenue Code, may capitalize that cost in the same manner and to the same extent that the taxable entity capitalized that cost on its federal income tax return or may expense those costs, except for costs excluded under Subsection (e), or in accordance with Subsections (c), (d), and (f).  If the taxable entity elects to capitalize costs, it must capitalize each cost allowed under this section that it capitalized on its federal income tax return.  If the taxable entity later elects to begin expensing a cost that may be allowed under this section as a cost of goods sold, the entity may not deduct any cost in ending inventory from a previous report.  If the taxable entity elects to expense a cost of goods sold that may be allowed under this section, a cost incurred before the first day of the period on which the report is based may not be subtracted as a cost of goods sold.  If the taxable entity elects to expense a cost of goods sold and later elects to capitalize that cost of goods sold, a cost expensed on a previous report may not be capitalized.
(h)  A taxable entity shall determine its cost of goods sold, except as otherwise provided by this section, in accordance with the methods used on the federal income tax return on which the report under this chapter is based.  This subsection does not affect the type or category of cost of goods sold that may be subtracted under this section.
(i)  A taxable entity may make a subtraction under this section in relation to the cost of goods sold only if that entity owns the goods.  The determination of whether a taxable entity is an owner is based on all of the facts and circumstances, including the various benefits and burdens of ownership vested with the taxable entity.  A taxable entity furnishing labor or materials to a project for the construction, improvement, remodeling, repair, or industrial maintenance (as the term "maintenance" is defined in 34 T.A.C. Section 3.357) of real property is considered to be an owner of that labor or materials and may include the costs, as allowed by this section, in the computation of cost of goods sold.  Solely for purposes of this section, a taxable entity shall be treated as the owner of goods being manufactured or produced by the entity under a contract with the federal government, including any subcontracts that support a contract with the federal government, notwithstanding that the Federal Acquisition Regulation may require that title or risk of loss with respect to those goods be transferred to the federal government before the manufacture or production of those goods is complete.
(j)  A taxable entity may not make a subtraction under this section for cost of goods sold to the extent the cost of goods sold was funded by partner contributions and deducted under Subsection (c)(13).
(k)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the taxable entity is a lending institution that offers loans to the public and elects to subtract cost of goods sold, the entity, other than an entity primarily engaged in an activity described by category 5932 of the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification Manual published by the federal Office of Management and Budget, may subtract as a cost of goods sold an amount equal to interest expense.  For purposes of this subsection, an entity engaged in lending to unrelated parties solely for agricultural production offers loans to the public.
(k-1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the following taxable entities may subtract as a cost of goods sold the costs otherwise allowed by this section in relation to tangible personal property that the entity rents or leases in the ordinary course of business of the entity:
(1)  a motor vehicle rental or leasing company that remits a tax on gross receipts imposed under Section 
152.026
;
(2)  a heavy construction equipment rental or leasing company; and
(3)  a railcar rolling stock rental or leasing company.
(k-2)  This subsection applies only to a pipeline entity: (1) that owns or leases and operates the pipeline by which the product is transported for others and only to that portion of the product to which the entity does not own title; and (2) that is primarily engaged in gathering, storing, transporting, or processing crude oil, including finished petroleum products, natural gas, condensate, and natural gas liquids, except for a refinery installation that manufactures finished petroleum products from crude oil. Notwithstanding Subsection (e)(3) or (i), a pipeline entity providing services for others related to the product that the pipeline does not own and to which this subsection applies may subtract as a cost of goods sold its depreciation, operations, and maintenance costs allowed by this section related to the services provided.
(k-3)  For purposes of Subsection (k-2), "processing" means the physical or mechanical removal, separation, or treatment of crude oil, including finished petroleum products, natural gas, condensate, and natural gas liquids after those materials are produced from the earth.  The term does not include the chemical or biological transformation of those materials.
(l)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a payment made by one member of an affiliated group to another member of that affiliated group not included in the combined group may be subtracted as a cost of goods sold only if it is a transaction made at arm's length.
(m)  In this section, "arm's length" means the standard of conduct under which entities that are not related parties and that have substantially equal bargaining power, each acting in its own interest, would negotiate or carry out a particular transaction.
(n)  In this section, "related party" means a person, corporation, or other entity, including an entity that is treated as a pass-through or disregarded entity for purposes of federal taxation, whether the person, corporation, or entity is subject to the tax under this chapter or not, in which one person, corporation, or entity, or set of related persons, corporations, or entities, directly or indirectly owns or controls a controlling interest in another entity.
(o)  If a taxable entity, including a taxable entity with respect to which cost of goods sold is determined pursuant to Section 
171.1014
(e)(1), whose principal business activity is film or television production or broadcasting or the distribution of tangible personal property described by Subsection (a)(3)(A)(ii), or any combination of these activities, elects to subtract cost of goods sold, the cost of goods sold for the taxable entity shall be the costs described in this section in relation to the property and include depreciation, amortization, and other expenses directly related to the acquisition, production, or use of the property, including expenses for the right to broadcast or use the property.
(t)  If a taxable entity that is a movie theater elects to subtract cost of goods sold, the cost of goods sold for the taxable entity shall be the costs described by this section in relation to the acquisition, production, exhibition, or use of a film or motion picture, including expenses for the right to use the film or motion picture.

(c)  High-cost gas produced from a well that is spudded or completed after August 31, 1996, is entitled to a reduction of the tax imposed by this chapter for the first 120 consecutive calendar months beginning on the first day of production, or until the cumulative value of the tax reduction equals 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred for the well, whichever occurs first.  The amount of tax reduction shall be computed by subtracting from the tax rate imposed by Section 
201.052
 the product of that tax rate times the ratio of drilling and completion costs incurred for the well to twice the median drilling and completion costs for high-cost wells spudded or completed during the previous state fiscal year, except that the effective rate of tax may not be reduced below zero.
(d)  Repealed by Acts 2017, 85th Leg., R.S., Ch. 358 (H.B. 
2277
), Sec. 3, eff. September 1, 2017.
(e)  The operator of a proposed or existing gas well, including a gas well that has not been completed, may apply to the commission for certification that the well produces or will produce high-cost gas.  The application may be made at any time after the first day of production.  The application may be made but is not required to be made concurrently with a request for a determination that gas produced from the well is high-cost natural gas for purposes of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (15 U.S.C. Section 3301 et seq.).  The commission may require an applicant to provide the commission with any relevant information required to administer this section.  For purposes of this section, a determination that gas is high-cost natural gas for purposes of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (15 U.S.C. Section 3301 et seq.) is a certification that the gas is high-cost gas for purposes of this section, and in that event additional certification is not required to qualify for the tax reduction provided by this section.
(f)  To qualify for the tax reduction provided by this section, the person responsible for paying the tax must apply to the comptroller.  The application must contain the certification of the commission that the well produces high-cost gas and must contain a report of drilling and completion costs incurred for each well on a form and in the detail as determined by the comptroller.  Drilling and completion costs for a recompletion shall only include current and contemporaneous costs associated with the recompletion.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, to obtain the maximum tax reduction, an application to the comptroller for certification according to Subsection (a)(2) must be filed with the comptroller at the later of the 180th day after the date of first production or the 45th day after the date of approval by the commission.  If the application is not filed by the applicable deadline, the tax reduction is reduced by 10 percent for the period beginning on the 180th day after the first day of production and ending on the date on which the application is filed with the comptroller.   The comptroller shall approve the application of a person who demonstrates that the gas is eligible for the tax reduction.  The comptroller may require a person applying for the tax reduction to provide any relevant information in the person's monthly report that the comptroller considers necessary to administer this section.  The commission shall notify the comptroller in writing immediately if it determines that a well previously certified as producing high-cost gas does not produce high-cost gas or if it takes any action or discovers any information that affects the eligibility of gas for a tax reduction under this section.
(g)  As soon as practicable after March 1 of each year, the comptroller shall determine the median drilling and completion cost for all high-cost wells for which an application for a tax reduction was made during the previous state fiscal year.  In making the determination, the comptroller shall use the drilling and completion cost data required to be reported to the comptroller under Subsection (f).  The median drilling and completion cost shall be used to compute the reduced tax under Subsection (c) and is fixed on the date of the comptroller's determination under this subsection.
(g-1)  The report of drilling and completion costs required under Subsection (f) may not be amended after March 1 of the year following the state fiscal year in which the application was made.
(h)  Information regarding drilling and completion costs included on an application under Subsection (f) is confidential and may not be disclosed, except to the extent aggregated with other similar information to produce industry averages.  Unauthorized disclosure is an offense subject to the same penalty as provided by Section 
111.007
 for unauthorized disclosure of federal tax return information.
(i)  If, before the commission certifies that a well produces high-cost gas or before the comptroller approves an application for a tax reduction under this section, the tax imposed by this chapter is paid on high-cost gas that otherwise qualifies for the tax reduction provided by this section, the person who remitted the tax is entitled to a refund in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the tax paid on the gas and the amount of tax that would have been paid on the gas if it had received a tax reduction under this section. The total allowable refund for taxes paid for reporting periods before the date the application is filed may not exceed the total tax paid on the gas that otherwise qualified for the tax reduction and that was produced during the 24 consecutive calendar months immediately preceding the month in which the application for certification under this section that the comptroller approved was filed with the commission.   To receive a refund, the person entitled to the refund must apply to the comptroller for the refund not later than the first anniversary after the date the comptroller approves the application for a tax reduction under this section.

SUBCHAPTER C. DETERMINING VALUE
Sec. 201.101.  MARKET VALUE.  (a)  The market value of gas is its value at the mouth of the well from which it is produced.  The value of gas at the mouth of the well is determined by ascertaining the producer's actual marketing costs and subtracting those costs from the producer's gross cash receipts from the sale of the gas.
(b)  Marketing costs are the costs incurred by the producer to get the gas from the mouth of the well to the market, including:
(1)  costs for compressing the gas sold;
(2)  costs for dehydrating the gas sold;
(3)  costs for sweetening the gas sold;  and
(4)  costs for delivering the gas to the purchaser.
(c)  Marketing costs do not include:
(1)  costs incurred in producing the gas;
(2)  costs incurred in normal lease separation of the oil or condensate;  or
(3)  insurance premiums on the marketing facility.
(d)  Marketing costs are determined by adding:
(1)  a reasonable charge for depreciation of the marketing facility being used, provided that, if the facility is rented, the actual rental fee is added;
(2)  a return on the producer-owned investment equal to six percent per year on the average depreciable balance;
(3)  costs of direct or allocated labor associated with the marketing facility;
(4)  costs of materials, supplies, maintenance, repairs, and fuel associated with the marketing facility;  and
(5)  ad valorem taxes paid on the marketing facility.
(e)  If the facility is used for a purpose other than marketing the gas being sold, the cost shall be allocated accordingly.
(f)  If the facility is handling gas for outside parties, the average cost for handling all of the gas shall be applied against the facility owner's gas.
(g)  The actual cost being charged a producer by an outside party for marketing functions may be used for tax purposes if no other benefit or value accrues to the producer.
(h)  A producer receiving a cost reimbursement from the gas purchaser shall include the reimbursement in the gross cash receipts and is entitled to deduct the actual marketing costs incurred.

Sec. 201.104.  RETURNED CYCLE GAS.  (a)  If gas is processed for its liquid hydrocarbon content and the residue gas is returned to a gas-producing formation by cycling methods, as distinguished from repressuring or pressure maintenance methods, the taxable value of the gas is three-fifths the value of all liquid hydrocarbons extracted, separated, and saved from the gas.
(b)  The value of the liquid hydrocarbons for the purpose of this section is the highest posted price of crude oil in the field where the gas is produced.  If no oil is produced in that field, the value is the highest posted price for crude oil in the nearest oil field.
(c)  The value of the liquid hydrocarbons is determined when they are extracted and separated from gas and before they are absorbed, refined, or processed.  The quantity of the liquid hydrocarbons is the yield from the gas at the processing plant.
(d)  The valuation method prescribed by this section controls over the valuation methods described in Sections 
201.102
 and 
201.103
 of this code only in circumstances in which Subsection (a) of this section applies.

(2)  "Commission" means the Railroad Commission of Texas.
(3)  "Enhanced recovery project" means the use of any process for the displacement of oil from the earth other than primary recovery and includes the use of an immiscible, miscible, chemical, thermal, or biological process and any co-production project.
(4)  "Existing enhanced recovery project" means an enhanced recovery project that began active operations before September 1, 1989.
(5)  "Expanded enhanced recovery project" or "expansion" means the addition of injection and producing wells, the change of injection pattern, or other operating changes to an existing enhanced oil recovery project that will result in the recovery of oil that would not otherwise be recovered.
(6)  "Incremental production" means the volume of oil produced by an expanded enhanced recovery project in excess of the production decline rate established under conditions before expansion for an existing enhanced recovery project.
(7)  "Operator" means the person responsible for the actual physical operation of an enhanced recovery project.
(8)  "Positive production response" means that the rate of oil production from the wells affected by an enhanced recovery project is greater than the rate that would have occurred without the project.
(9)  "Primary recovery" means the displacement of oil from the earth into the well bore by means of the natural pressure of the oil reservoir, including artificial lift.
(10)  "Production decline rate" means the projected future oil production from a project area as extrapolated by a method approved by the commission.
(11)  "Recovered oil tax rate" means the tax rate provided by Section 
202.052
(b) of this code.

(14)  "Co-production project" means an enhanced recovery project in which water is permanently removed from an oil and/or gas reservoir in an effort to lower the gas-water or oil-water contact in the reservoir or to reduce reservoir pressure to recover entrained hydrocarbons from the reservoir that would not be produced by conventional primary or secondary production methods.
(15)  "Commission approved co-production project" means a reservoir development project in which the commission has recognized that water withdrawals from an oil or gas reservoir in excess of specified minimum volumes will result in recovery of additional oil and/or gas from the reservoir that would not be produced by conventional production methods and where operators in the field have begun to implement commission requirements to withdraw such volumes of water and dispose of such water outside the subject reservoir.  Reservoirs potentially eligible for this designation shall be limited to those reservoirs in which oil and/or gas has been bypassed by water encroachment caused by production from the reservoir and such bypassed oil and/or gas may be produced as a result of fieldwide high-volume water withdrawals of natural formation water.
(16)  "High-volume water withdrawals" means the withdrawal of water from a reservoir in an amount sufficient to dewater portions of the reservoir containing oil and/or gas previously bypassed by water encroachment.
(b)  Oil produced from an enhanced recovery project other than a co-production project qualifies for the recovered oil tax rate if, before the project begins active operation, the commission approves the project and designates the area to be affected by the project.  The incremental production from an expanded enhanced recovery project other than a co-production project qualifies for the recovered oil tax rate if, before the expansion begins, the commission approves the expansion and designates the area to be affected by the expansion.  For a new or expanded enhanced recovery project, other than a co-production project, for which an application for approval under this section is filed with the commission on or after January 1, 1994, severance tax for all oil produced during the period from January 1, 1994, through August 31, 1995, to which the recovered tax rate is applicable, must be paid when due at the rate provided by Section 
202.052
(a) of this code.  On or after January 1, 1996, the payor may apply to the comptroller for and shall be entitled to receive a tax credit equal to the difference between the tax paid and the tax which would have been due at the recovered oil tax rate for all production to which the recovered tax rate is applicable during the period from January 1, 1994, through August 31, 1995.  The tax credit may be applied to either oil or gas severance taxes regardless of the field from which the production originates.  Oil produced from a commission approved co-production project, whether a new enhanced recovery project or an expanded enhanced recovery project, qualifies for the recovered oil tax rate following commission certification of a positive production response without regard to whether the commission approval is before or after the project began active operations;  provided, however, tax must be paid when due at the rate provided in Section 
202.052
(a) of this code for all oil produced on or before July 31, 1995.  On or after September 1, 1995, the operator may apply to the comptroller for a refund and shall be entitled to receive a refund equal to the difference between the tax paid on all oil produced from a commission approved co-production project after commission certification of a positive production response and the tax due at the recovered oil tax rate for all oil produced after commission certification of a positive production response from such co-production project.  The operator of a proposed project or a proposed expansion may apply to the commission for approval of the project or expansion under this section.  The commission may require an applicant to provide the commission with any relevant information required to administer this section.  If approval by the commission of a unitization agreement under Subchapter 
B
, Chapter 
101
, Natural Resources Code, is required for purposes of carrying out the project or expansion, the commission may not approve the project or expansion unless it approves the unitization agreement.  A person may apply for approval of a proposed enhanced recovery project or a proposed expansion under this subsection concurrently with an application for approval of a unitization agreement for purposes of carrying out the enhanced recovery project or expansion under Section 
101.011
, Natural Resources Code, or with an application for certification of the project or expansion as a tertiary recovery project for purposes of Section 4993, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or may make a separate application for approval.
(c)  This section applies to an enhanced recovery project that begins active operation on or after September 1, 1989, and to an expansion that the commission approves on or after September 1, 1991.  An application for approval under this section must be filed on or after September 1, 1989, for a new enhanced recovery project.  An application for approval under this section must be filed on or after September 1, 1991, for an expansion of an existing enhanced recovery project.  A project may not qualify as an expansion if the project has qualified as a new enhanced recovery project under this section.  An application may be filed on or after September 1, 1989, even if a separate application for approval of the project or expansion has already been filed under Subchapter 
B
, Chapter 
101
, Natural Resources Code, or for approval as a tertiary recovery project for purposes of Section 4993, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, if the operation of a new project or the expansion of an existing project, other than a co-production project, does not begin before the application for approval under this section is approved by the commission;  provided, however, nothing herein shall require commission approval of a co-production project prior to commencing active operations on such project in order for such project to be eligible for the recovered oil tax rate.
(d)  An applicant for commission approval of a co-production project shall submit a written application for approval to the commission.  Such application must be filed before January 1, 1994.  The applicant shall provide the commission with any relevant information required to administer this section, including evidence demonstrating that the reservoir is eligible for the designation and demonstrating the minimum volumes of high-volume water withdrawal required to recover oil and/or gas from the reservoir that would not be produced by conventional production methods.  A commission representative may administratively approve the application.  If the commission representative denies administrative approval, the applicant shall have the right to a hearing upon request.
(e)  If the commission approves an enhanced recovery project or an expansion under this section, it shall issue a certification of approval for an approved project designating the area to be affected by the project.
(f)  The recovered oil tax rate applies only to oil produced from a new enhanced oil recovery project, any co-production project, or the incremental production caused by the expansion of an existing enhanced recovery project from the area the commission certifies to be affected by the project.
(g)  Subject to the provisions of Subsections (b) and (h) of this section, the recovered oil tax rate applies to oil on which a tax is imposed by this chapter for the 10 years beginning the first day of the month following the date the commission certifies that, in the case of an enhanced recovery project including a co-production project, a positive production response has occurred or, in the case of an expansion, other than related to a co-production project, incremental production has occurred, if the application for certification is filed:
(1)  not later than three years from the date the commission approves the project if the project is designated as a new or existing project other than a co-production project that uses a secondary recovery process;  or
(2)  not later than five years from the date the commission approves the project if the project is designated as a new or existing project that uses a tertiary recovery process or is a co-production project.
(h)  The operator may designate the certification date, subject to commission approval.  If the commission determines that the project has caused a positive production response or incremental production, the commission shall certify that fact.
(i)  Notwithstanding Subsection (g) of this section, qualification for the recovered oil tax rate ends on the first day of the first calendar month that begins on or after the 91st day following the date of termination of the active operation of the enhanced recovery project or of termination of an approved expansion.
(j)  If the active operation of an approved enhanced recovery project or expansion is terminated, the person who immediately before the termination is the operator of the project shall notify the commission and the comptroller in writing not later than the 30th day after the last day of active operation.  Any person who violates this subsection is liable to the state for a civil penalty if the person pays or attempts to pay the tax imposed by this chapter on oil from the project at the recovered oil tax rate after qualification for that rate ends under Subsection (g) or (i) of this section.  The amount of the penalty may not exceed the sum of:
(1)  $10,000;  and
(2)  the difference between the amount of taxes paid or attempted to be paid and the amount of taxes due.
(k)  The attorney general may recover a penalty under Subsection (j) of this section in a suit brought on behalf of the state.  Venue for the suit is in Travis County.
(l)  The commission has broad discretion in administering this section and shall adopt and enforce any appropriate rules or orders that the commission finds necessary to administer this section concerning the designation, operation, and termination of enhanced recovery projects and expansions.  The commission shall notify the comptroller of any action taken under this subsection.  The comptroller shall have the power to establish procedures in order to comply with this Act.
(m)  Subject to the provisions of Subsection (b) of this section, if , before the comptroller approves an application for taxation at the recovered oil tax rate, the tax imposed by this chapter is paid at the rate provided by Section 
202.052
(a) of this code on oil that qualifies under this section for the recovered oil tax rate, the producer or producers of the oil are entitled to a credit against taxes imposed by this chapter in an amount equal to the difference between the tax paid on the oil and the tax due on the oil at the recovered oil tax rate.  The credit is allocated to each producer according to the producer's proportionate share in the oil.  To receive a credit, one or more of the producers of the oil must apply to the comptroller for the credit not later than the first anniversary after the date the commission certifies that a positive production response has occurred.
(n)  To qualify for the taxation of oil at the recovered oil tax rate, a person responsible for paying the tax must apply to the comptroller.  The application must include the certification of the commission that the project or expansion has been approved and that the project has resulted in a positive production response or that the expansion has resulted in incremental production.  The comptroller shall approve the application of a person who demonstrates that the oil is eligible for taxation at the recovered oil tax rate.  The comptroller may require a person applying for the recovered oil tax rate to provide any relevant information in the person's monthly report and internal records that the comptroller considers necessary to administer this section.  The commission shall notify the comptroller in writing immediately if it determines that active operation of an approved enhanced recovery project or an approved expansion has been terminated or if it takes any action or discovers any information that affects the taxation of oil at the recovered oil tax rate.

Sec. 202.0545.  TAX EXEMPTION FOR ENHANCED RECOVERY PROJECTS USING ANTHROPOGENIC CARBON DIOXIDE.  (a)  Subject to the limitations provided by this section, until the 30th anniversary of the date that the comptroller first approves an application for a tax rate reduction under this section, the producer of oil recovered through an enhanced oil recovery project that qualifies under Section 
202.054
 for the recovered oil tax rate provided by Section 
202.052
(b) is entitled to an additional 50 percent reduction in that tax rate if in the recovery of the oil the enhanced oil recovery project uses carbon dioxide that:
(1)  is captured from an anthropogenic source in this state;
(2)  would otherwise be released into the atmosphere as industrial emissions;
(3)  is measurable at the source of capture; and
(4)  is sequestered in one or more geological formations in this state following the enhanced oil recovery process.
(b)  In the event that a portion of the carbon dioxide used in the enhanced oil recovery project is anthropogenic carbon dioxide that satisfies the criteria of Subsection (a) and a portion of the carbon dioxide used in the project fails to satisfy the criteria of Subsection (a) because it is not anthropogenic, the tax reduction provided by Subsection (a) shall be reduced to reflect the proportion of the carbon dioxide used in the project that satisfies the criteria of Subsection (a).
(c)  To qualify for the tax rate reduction under this section, the operator must:
(1)  apply to the comptroller for the reduction and include with the application any information and documentation that the comptroller may require; and
(2)  apply for a certification from  the Railroad Commission of Texas.
(d)  The Railroad Commission of Texas may issue a certification under Subsection (c)(2) only if the commission finds that, based on substantial evidence, there is a reasonable expectation that:
(1)  at least 99 percent of the carbon dioxide sequestered as required by Subsection (a)(4) will remain sequestered for at least 1,000 years; and
(2)  the operator's planned sequestration program will include appropriately designed monitoring and verification measures that will be employed for a period sufficient to demonstrate whether the sequestration program is performing as expected.
(e)  The tax rate reduction does not apply if the operator's sequestration program or the operator's monitoring and verification measures differ substantially from the planned program described by Subsection (d), and the operator shall refund the difference between the amount of the tax paid under this section and the amount that would have been imposed in the absence of this section.
(f)  The comptroller shall approve the application if the operator submits the certification required by Subsection (c)(2) and if the comptroller determines that the oil is otherwise eligible under this section.
(g)  If, before the comptroller approves an application for the tax rate reduction under this section, the tax imposed by this chapter is paid at the rate provided by Section 
202.052
(a) or (b) on oil that qualifies under this section, the producer or producers of the oil are entitled to a credit against taxes imposed by this chapter in an amount equal to the difference between the tax paid on the oil and the tax due on the oil after the rate reduction under this section is applied.  The credit is allowed to each producer according to the producer's proportionate share in the oil.  To receive a credit, one or more of the producers of the oil must apply to the comptroller for the credit not later than the first anniversary of the date the oil is produced.
(h)  The comptroller and the Railroad Commission of Texas may adopt rules and establish procedures to implement and administer this section.

Sec. 202.057.  TAX CREDIT FOR INCREMENTAL PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES.  (a)  In this section:
(1)  "Baseline production" means a lease's average monthly production during the four highest months of production in the time period from January 1, 1996, through December 31, 1996.
(2)  "Commission" means the Railroad Commission of Texas.
(3)  "Incremental production" means production from a qualifying lease in excess of the baseline production.
(4)  "Incremental production technique" means any secondary or tertiary production enhancement technique.  For wells in primary production, the use of incremental production techniques means that an expenditure of at least $5,000 must have been made to cause increased production.  Operators must certify to the commission that such expenditure has been made to qualify for the tax exemption.  The incremental production techniques listed in this subdivision must cause incremental production from an existing oil lease or from a newly drilled single-completion well on an existing lease.
(5)  "Incremental ratio" means the amount of a qualifying lease's average monthly incremental production during the four-month period used to meet the definition of a qualifying lease divided by its average monthly total production during the same four-month period.
(6)  "Qualifying lease" means a commission-designated oil lease whose production during the four-month period used in computing the baseline is no more than seven barrels of oil equivalents per day per well, excluding gas flared pursuant to the rules of the commission, and which has shown incremental production for four of five consecutive months on or after September 1, 1997, and after performing an incremental production technique within the lease.  For purposes of qualifying a lease, production per well per day is measured by dividing the sum of lease production during the four highest months of production in the baseline period by the sum of the number of well-days, where a well-day is one well producing for one day.
(7)  "Qualified incremental production" means the lease's monthly total production multiplied by the incremental ratio.
(b)  An operator of a qualifying lease is entitled to a 50 percent tax exemption on that lease's qualified incremental production for five years provided that:
(1)  the incremental production required to define a qualifying lease occurred after September 1, 1997, and before December 31, 1998;
(2)  the operator of a qualifying lease applies to the commission for a determination of a lease's incremental ratio before February 11, 1999;  and
(3)  the operator provides to the comptroller a commission-certified incremental ratio.
(c)  If the comptroller's average taxable price of crude oil reaches $25 per barrel, adjusted to 1997 dollars, for three consecutive months, the tax credit under this section shall be suspended until the price drops below $25 per barrel, adjusted to 1997 dollars, for three consecutive months.
(d)  If the tax is paid at the full rate provided by Section 
201.052
(a) or (b) or Section 
202.052
(a) or (b) before the comptroller approves an application for an exemption provided in this chapter, the operator is entitled to a credit against taxes imposed by this chapter in an amount equal to 50 percent of the tax paid on the incremental production.  To receive the credit, the operator must apply to the comptroller for the credit not later than the first anniversary after the date the commission certifies the incremental ratio for a qualifying lease.
(e)  The commission may enact rules necessary to administer the provisions of this section.

Sec. 202.058.  CREDITS FOR QUALIFYING LOW-PRODUCING OIL LEASES.  (a)  In this section:
(1)  "Commission" means the Railroad Commission of Texas.
(2)  "Qualifying low-producing oil lease" means a well classified as an oil well that is part of a lease whose production during a 90-day period is less than:
(A)  15 barrels of oil per day of production; or
(B)  five percent recoverable oil per barrel of produced water.
(b)  For purposes of qualifying a lease, production per well per day is determined by computing the average daily per well production from the lease using the greater of the monthly production from the well as reported in the monthly lease production reports made to the commission and the monthly production from the well as reported in the producer's reports made to the comptroller under Section 
202.201
, including any amendments to those reports.  For purposes of qualifying a lease, production per well per day is measured by dividing the sum of lease production during the three-month period by the sum of the number of well-days, where a well-day is one well producing for one day.  The operator of a lease that is eligible for a credit under this section only on the basis of Subsection (a)(2)(B) must pay to the comptroller a filing fee of $100 before the comptroller may authorize the credit.
(c)  Each month, the comptroller shall certify the average taxable price of oil, adjusted to 2005 dollars, during the previous three months based on various price indices available to producers, including the reported Texas Panhandle Spot Price, West Texas Intermediate Crude Spot Price, New York Mercantile Exchange, or other spot prices, as applicable.  The comptroller shall publish certifications under this subsection in the Texas Register.
(d)  An operator of a qualifying low-producing lease is entitled to a 25 percent credit on the tax otherwise due on oil produced from that lease during a month if the average taxable price of oil certified by the comptroller under Subsection (c) for the previous three-month period is more than $25 per barrel but not more than $30 per barrel.
(e)  An operator of a qualifying low-producing lease is entitled to a 50 percent credit on the tax otherwise due on oil produced from that lease during a month if the average taxable price of oil certified by the comptroller under Subsection (c) for the previous three-month period is more than $22 per barrel but not more than $25 per barrel.
(f)  An operator of a qualifying low-producing lease is entitled to a 100 percent credit on the tax otherwise due on oil produced from that lease during a month if the average taxable price of oil certified by the comptroller under Subsection (c) for the previous three-month period is not more than $22 per barrel.
(g)  If the tax is paid on oil at the full rate provided by Section 
202.052
, the person paying the tax is entitled to a credit against taxes imposed by this chapter or Chapter 
201
 on the amount overpaid.  To receive the credit, the person must apply to the comptroller for the credit not later than the expiration of the applicable period for filing a tax refund under Section 
111.104
.
 
Subsec. (h) was repealed by Acts 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., Ch. 911 (H.B.

Sec. 202.059.  EXEMPTION FOR HYDROCARBONS FROM TERRA WELLS.  (a)  Hydrocarbons produced from a well subject to an agreement under Chapter 93, Natural Resources Code, and under a license issued under that chapter qualify for an exemption from the taxes imposed by this chapter and Chapter 
201
 if the comptroller approves the tax exemption under Subsection (g).
(b)  Hydrocarbons produced from a well formerly subject to an agreement under Chapter 93, Natural Resources Code, and a license issued under that chapter resuming production after participation in TERRA for two years qualify for an exemption from the taxes imposed by this chapter and Chapter 
201
 if the comptroller approves the tax exemption under Subsection (g).
(c)  The commission may certify a well eligible for a tax exemption or an application may be made to the commission for certification under this section.  The commission may require an applicant to provide the commission with any relevant information required to administer this section.  The commission shall issue a certificate to each operator of the well.  The certificate must:
(1)  include identification of the well;  and
(2)  state the date on which the tax exemption takes effect, subject to the comptroller's approval of the exemption under Subsection (g).
(d)  The commission shall furnish to the comptroller a copy of a certificate of exemption for each well qualifying under this section.
(e)  The commission may revoke a certificate for a tax exemption if information indicates that a well was not eligible for that designation at the time of certification or if a license issued under Chapter 93, Natural Resources Code, is revoked by the commission.  The commission shall notify the operator and the comptroller that a certificate has been revoked.  A tax exemption granted under this section is automatically revoked on the date the certificate is revoked, and hydrocarbons produced from the well after the date of revocation are not eligible for the tax exemption.
(f)  The commission may adopt and enforce any rules or orders that the commission finds necessary to administer this section.
(g)  To qualify for the tax exemption, the person responsible for paying the tax must apply to the comptroller for the exemption and include with the application the certificate issued by the commission under Subsection (c).  The comptroller shall approve the application of a person if the hydrocarbons are eligible for the tax exemption.  The comptroller may require a person applying for the tax exemption to provide any relevant information necessary to administer this section.  The comptroller may establish procedures to comply with this subsection and Subsection (h).
(h)  If the tax is paid at the full rate provided by this chapter and Chapter 
201
 on hydrocarbons produced on or after the effective date of the tax exemption but before the date the comptroller approves an application for the tax exemption, the operator is entitled to a credit on taxes due under Chapter 
201
 or this chapter in the amount equal to the tax paid during that period.  To receive a credit, the operator must apply to the comptroller for the credit not later than one year after the date the commission certifies the well for a tax exemption.
(i)  A person is subject to the penalties that may be imposed under Chapters 
85
 and 
91
, Natural Resources Code, if the person makes and submits to the commission or comptroller an application, report, or other document used or intended to be used for a certification, tax exemption, or tax credit under this section and the person knows that the application, report, or other document contains a false or untrue material fact.
(j)  A person is liable to the state for a civil penalty if the person, after receiving notice from the commission that the person's tax exemption certificate for a TERRA well or a former TERRA well has been revoked, applies or attempts to apply for a tax exemption for hydrocarbons produced from the well under the revoked certificate.  The amount of the penalty may not exceed the sum of:
(1)  $10,000;  and
(2)  the difference between the amount of taxes paid or attempted to be paid and the amount of taxes due.
(k)  The attorney general may recover a penalty under Subsection (j) in a suit brought on behalf of the state.  Venue for the suit is in Travis County.

Sec. 311.0101.  PARTICIPATION OF DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES IN CERTAIN ZONES.  (a)  It is the goal of the legislature, subject to the constitutional requirements spelled out by the United States Supreme Court in J. A. Croson Company v. City of Richmond (822 F.2d 1355) and as hereafter further elaborated by federal and state courts, that all disadvantaged businesses in the zone designated under Section 
311.005
(a)(4) be given full and complete access to the procurement process whereby supplies, materials, services, and equipment are acquired by the board.  It is also the intent of the legislature that to the extent constitutionally permissible, a preference be given to disadvantaged businesses.  The board and general contractor shall give preference, among bids or other proposals that are otherwise comparable, to a bid or other proposal by a disadvantaged business having its home office located in this state.
(b)  It is the intent of the legislature that the zone shall:
(1)  implement a program or programs targeted to disadvantaged businesses in order to inform them fully about the zone procurement process and the requirements for their participation in that process;
(2)  implement such steps as are necessary to ensure that all disadvantaged businesses are made fully aware of opportunities in the zone, including but not limited to specific opportunities to submit bids and proposals.  Steps that may be appropriate in certain circumstances include mailing requests for proposals or notices inviting bids to all disadvantaged businesses in the county;
(3)  require prime contractors, as part of their responses to requests for proposals or bids, to make a specific showing of how they intend to maximize participation by disadvantaged businesses as subcontractors.  The zone shall be required to evaluate such actions by prime contractors as a factor in the award of contracts within the zone procurement process;
(4)  identify disadvantaged businesses in the county that provide or have the potential to provide supplies, materials, services, and equipment to the zone;  and
(5)  identify barriers to participation by disadvantaged businesses in the zone procurement process, such as bonding, insurance, and working capital requirements that may be imposed on businesses.
(c)  It is the intent of the legislature that the zone shall be required to develop a program pursuant to this Act for the purchase of supplies, materials, services, and equipment and that the board of the zone compile a report on an annual basis listing the total number and dollar amount of contracts awarded to disadvantaged businesses during the previous year as well as the total number and dollar amount of all contracts awarded.  Such annual report shall be available for inspection by the general public during regular business hours.
(d)  The board by rule shall adopt goals for the participation of minority business enterprises and women-owned business enterprises in the awarding of state contracts for professional services.  To implement the participation goals, the board shall encourage each issuer to award to minority business enterprises and women-owned business enterprises not less than 15 percent of the total value of all professional services contract awards that the issuer expects to make in its fiscal year.

Sec. 311.011.  PROJECT AND FINANCING PLANS.  (a)  The board of directors of a reinvestment zone shall prepare and adopt a project plan and a reinvestment zone financing plan for the zone and submit the plans to the governing body of the municipality or county that designated the zone.
(b)  The project plan must include:
(1)  a description and map showing existing uses and conditions of real property in the zone and proposed uses of that property;
(2)  proposed changes of zoning ordinances, the master plan of the municipality, building codes, other municipal ordinances, and subdivision rules and regulations, if any, of the county, if applicable;
(3)  a list of estimated nonproject costs; and
(4)  a statement of a method of relocating persons to be displaced, if any, as a result of implementing the plan.
(c)  The reinvestment zone financing plan must include:
(1)  a detailed list describing the estimated project costs of the zone, including administrative expenses;
(2)  a statement listing the proposed kind, number, and location of all public works or public improvements to be financed by the zone;
(3)  a finding that the plan is economically feasible and an economic feasibility study;
(4)  the estimated amount of bonded indebtedness to be incurred;
(5)  the estimated time when related costs or monetary obligations are to be incurred;
(6)  a description of the methods of financing all estimated project costs and the expected sources of revenue to finance or pay project costs, including the percentage of tax increment to be derived from the property taxes of each taxing unit anticipated to contribute tax increment to the zone that levies taxes on real property in the zone;
(7)  the current total appraised value of taxable real property in the zone;
(8)  the estimated captured appraised value of the zone during each year of its existence; and
(9)  the duration of the zone.
(d)  The governing body of the municipality or county that designated the zone must approve a project plan or reinvestment zone financing plan after its adoption by the board. The approval must be by ordinance, in the case of a municipality, or by order, in the case of a county, that finds that the plan is feasible.
(e)  The board of directors of the zone at any time may adopt an amendment to the project plan consistent with the requirements and limitations of this chapter.  The amendment takes effect on approval by the governing body of the municipality or county that created the zone.  That approval must be by ordinance, in the case of a municipality, or by order, in the case of a county.  If an amendment reduces or increases the geographic area of the zone, increases the amount of bonded indebtedness to be incurred, increases or decreases the percentage of a tax increment to be contributed by a taxing unit, increases the total estimated project costs, or designates additional property in the zone to be acquired by the municipality or county, the approval must be by ordinance or order, as applicable, adopted after a public hearing that satisfies the procedural requirements of Sections 
311.003
(c) and (d).
(f)  In a zone designated under Section 
311.005
(a)(4) that is located in a county with a population of 3.3 million or more, the project plan must provide that at least one-third of the tax increment of the zone be used to provide affordable housing during the term of the zone.
(g)  A school district that participates in a zone is not required to increase the percentage or amount of the tax increment to be contributed by the school district because of an amendment to the project plan or reinvestment zone financing plan for the zone unless the governing body of the school district by official action approves the amendment.
(h)  Unless specifically provided otherwise in the plan, all amounts contained in the project plan or reinvestment zone financing plan, including amounts of expenditures relating to project costs and amounts relating to participation by taxing units, are considered estimates and do not act as a limitation on the described items, but the amounts contained in the project plan or reinvestment zone financing plan may not vary materially from the estimates.  This subsection may not be construed to increase the amount of any reduction under Section 
403.302
(d)(4), Government Code, in the total taxable value of the property in a school district that participates in the zone as computed under Section 
403.302
(d) of that code.

Sec. 311.012.  DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF TAX INCREMENT.  (a)  The amount of a taxing unit's tax increment for a year is the amount of property taxes levied and assessed by the unit for that year on the captured appraised value of real property taxable by the unit and located in a reinvestment zone or the amount of property taxes levied and collected by the unit for that year on the captured appraised value of real property taxable by the unit and located in a reinvestment zone.  The governing body of a taxing unit shall determine which of the methods specified by this subsection is used to calculate the amount of the unit's tax increment.
(b)  The captured appraised value of real property taxable by a taxing unit for a year is the total taxable value of all real property taxable by the unit and located in a reinvestment zone for that year less the tax increment base of the unit.
(c)  The tax increment base of a taxing unit is the total taxable value of all real property taxable by the unit and located in a reinvestment zone for the year in which the zone was designated under this chapter. If the boundaries of a zone are enlarged, the tax increment base is increased by the taxable value of the real property added to the zone for the year in which the property was added. If the boundaries of a zone are reduced, the tax increment base is reduced by the taxable value of the real property removed from the zone for the year in which the property was originally included in the zone's boundaries. If the municipality that designates a zone does not levy an ad valorem tax in the year in which the zone is designated, the tax increment base is determined by the appraisal district in which the zone is located using assumptions regarding exemptions and other relevant information provided to the appraisal district by the municipality.

Sec. 311.0123.  SALES TAX INCREMENT.  (a)  In this section, "sales tax base" for a reinvestment zone means the amount of municipal sales and use taxes attributable to the zone for the year in which the zone was designated under this chapter.
(b)  The governing body of a municipality may determine, in an ordinance designating an area as a reinvestment zone or in an ordinance adopted subsequent to the designation of a zone, the portion or amount of tax increment generated from municipal sales and use taxes attributable to the zone, above the sales tax base, to be deposited into the tax increment fund.  Nothing in this section requires a municipality to contribute sales tax increment into a tax increment fund.
(c)  Before the issuance of a bond, note, or other obligation under this chapter that pledges the payments into the tax increment fund under Subsection (b), the governing body of a municipality may enter into an agreement, under Subchapter 
E

(3)  make payments in accordance with an agreement made under Section 
311.010

Sec. 311.0125.  TAX ABATEMENT AGREEMENTS.  (a)  Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, a taxing unit other than a school district may enter into a tax abatement agreement with an owner of real or personal property in a reinvestment zone, regardless of whether the taxing unit deposits or agrees to deposit any portion of its tax increment into the tax increment fund.
(b)  To be effective, an agreement to abate taxes on real property in a reinvestment zone must be approved by:
(1)  the board of directors of the reinvestment zone;  and
(2)  the governing body of each taxing unit that imposes taxes on real property in the reinvestment zone and deposits or agrees to deposit any of its tax increment into the tax increment fund for the zone.
(c)  In any contract entered into by the board of directors of a reinvestment zone in connection with bonds or other obligations, the board may convenant  that the board will not approve a tax abatement agreement that applies to real property in that zone.
(d)  If a taxing unit enters into a tax abatement agreement authorized by this section, taxes that are abated under that agreement are not considered taxes to be imposed or produced by that taxing unit in calculating the amount of:
(1)  the tax increment of that taxing unit;  or
(2)  that taxing unit's deposit to the tax increment fund for the reinvestment zone.
(e)  The Texas Department of Economic Development or its successor may recommend that a taxing unit enter into a tax abatement agreement with a person under this chapter.  In determining whether to approve an agreement to abate taxes on real property in a reinvestment zone under Subsection (b), the board of directors of the reinvestment zone and the governing body of a taxing unit shall consider any recommendation made by the Texas Department of Economic Development or its successor.

Sec. 311.013.  COLLECTION AND DEPOSIT OF TAX INCREMENTS.  (a)  Each taxing unit that taxes real property located in a reinvestment zone shall provide for the collection of its taxes in the zone as for any other property taxed by the unit.
(b)  Each taxing unit shall pay into the tax increment fund for the zone an amount equal to the tax increment produced by the unit, less the sum of:
(1)  property taxes produced from the tax increments that are, by contract executed before the designation of the area as a reinvestment zone, required to be paid by the unit to another political subdivision; and
(2)  for a taxing unit other than the municipality that created the zone, a portion, not to exceed 15 percent, of the tax increment produced by the unit as provided by the reinvestment zone financing plan or a larger portion as provided by Subsection (f).
(c)  Notwithstanding any termination of the reinvestment zone under Section 
311.017
(a) and unless otherwise specified by an agreement between the taxing unit and the municipality or county that created the zone, a taxing unit shall make a payment required by Subsection (b) not later than the 90th day after the later of:
(1)  the delinquency date for the unit's property taxes; or
(2)  the date the municipality or county that created the zone submits to the taxing unit an invoice specifying the tax increment produced by the taxing unit and the amount the taxing unit is required to pay into the tax increment fund for the zone.
(c-1)  A delinquent payment incurs a penalty of five percent of the amount delinquent and accrues interest at an annual rate of 10 percent.

(e)  Repealed by Acts 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., Ch. 1032, Sec. 21, eff. June 17, 2011.
(f)  A taxing unit is not required to pay into the tax increment fund any of its tax increment produced from property located in a reinvestment zone designated under Section 
311.005
(a) or in an area added to a reinvestment zone under Section 
311.007
 unless the taxing unit enters into an agreement to do so with the governing body of the municipality or county that designated the zone. A taxing unit may enter into an agreement under this subsection at any time before or after the zone is designated or enlarged. The agreement may include conditions for payment of that tax increment into the fund and must specify the portion of the tax increment to be paid into the fund and the years for which that tax increment is to be paid into the fund. In addition to any other terms to which the parties may agree, the agreement may specify the projects to which a participating taxing unit's tax increment will be dedicated and that the taxing unit's participation may be computed with respect to a base year later than the original base year of the zone. The agreement and the conditions in the agreement are binding on the taxing unit, the municipality or county, and the board of directors of the zone.
(f-1)  This subsection does not apply to a hospital district to which Section 
281.095
, Health and Safety Code, applies.  Notwithstanding Subsection (f), the commissioners court of a county that enters into an agreement with the governing body of a municipality under Subsection (f) may enter into an agreement with the governing body of the municipality under that subsection on behalf of a taxing unit other than the county if by statute the ad valorem tax rate of the other taxing unit is approved by the commissioners court or the commissioners court is expressly required by statute to levy the ad valorem taxes of the other taxing unit.  The agreement entered into on behalf of the other taxing unit is not required to contain the same conditions as the agreement entered into on behalf of the county.  This subsection does not authorize the commissioners court of a county to enter into an agreement on behalf of another taxing unit solely because the county tax assessor-collector is required by law to assess or collect the taxing unit's ad valorem taxes.
(f-2)  This subsection does not apply to a hospital district to which Section 
281.095
, Health and Safety Code, applies.  Notwithstanding Subsection (f), the commissioners court of a county that creates a zone may provide by order for the payment into the tax increment fund for the zone of a portion of the tax increment produced by a taxing unit other than the county if by statute the ad valorem tax rate of the other taxing unit is approved by the commissioners court or the commissioners court is expressly required by statute to levy the ad valorem taxes of the other taxing unit.  The order may include conditions for payment of that tax increment into the fund that are different from the conditions applicable to the county's obligation to pay into the fund the tax increment produced by the county.  This subsection does not authorize the commissioners court of a county to provide for the payment into the fund of a portion of the tax increment produced by another taxing unit solely because the county tax assessor-collector is required by law to assess or collect the taxing unit's ad valorem taxes.
(g)  Subject to the provisions of Section 
311.0125
, in lieu of permitting a portion of its tax increment to be paid into the tax increment fund, and notwithstanding the provisions of Section 
312.203
, a taxing unit, including a municipality, may elect to offer the owners of taxable real property in a reinvestment zone created under this chapter an exemption from taxation of all or part of the value of the property.  To be effective, an agreement to exempt real property from ad valorem taxes under this subsection must be approved by:
(1)  the board of directors of the reinvestment zone; and
(2)  the governing body of each taxing unit that imposes taxes on real property in the reinvestment zone and deposits or agrees to deposit any of its tax increment into the tax increment fund for the zone.
(h)  Repealed by Acts 2003, 78th Leg., ch. 8, Sec. 1, eff. April 24, 2003.
(i)  Notwithstanding Subsection (c) and Section 
311.012
(a), a taxing unit is not required to pay into a tax increment fund the applicable portion of a tax increment attributable to delinquent taxes until those taxes are collected.
(j)  Section 
26.05
(f) does not prohibit a taxing unit from depositing all of the tax increment produced by the taxing unit in a reinvestment zone into the tax increment fund for that zone.
(k)  A school district is not required to pay into the tax increment fund any of its tax increment produced from property located in an area added to the reinvestment zone under Section 
311.007
(a) or (b) unless the governing body of the school district enters into an agreement to do so with the governing body of the municipality or county that created the zone.  The governing body of a school district may enter into an agreement under this subsection at any time before or after the zone is created or enlarged.  The agreement may include conditions for payment of that tax increment into the fund and must specify the portion of the tax increment to be paid into the fund and the years for which that tax increment is to be paid into the fund.  The agreement and the conditions in the agreement are binding on the school district, the municipality or county, and the board of directors of the zone.
(l)  The governing body of a municipality or county that designates an area as a reinvestment zone may determine, in the designating ordinance or order adopted under Section 
311.003
 or in the ordinance or order adopted under Section 
311.011
 approving the reinvestment zone financing plan for the zone, the portion of the tax increment produced by the municipality or county that the municipality or county is required to pay into the tax increment fund for the zone. If a municipality or county does not determine the portion of the tax increment produced by the municipality or county that the municipality or county is required to pay into the tax increment fund for a reinvestment zone, the municipality or county is required to pay into the fund for the zone the entire tax increment produced by the municipality or county, except as provided by Subsection (b)(1).
(m)  The governing body of a municipality that is located in a county with a population of more than 2.1 million but less than 2.5 million or in a county with a population of 3.3 million or more by ordinance may reduce the portion of the tax increment produced by the municipality that the municipality is required to pay into the tax increment fund for the zone.  The municipality may not reduce under this subsection the portion of the tax increment produced by the municipality that the municipality is required to pay into the tax increment fund for the zone unless the municipality provides each county that has entered into an agreement with the municipality to pay all or a portion of the county's tax increment into the fund an opportunity to enter into an agreement with the municipality to reduce the portion of the tax increment produced by the county that the county is required to pay into the tax increment fund for the zone by the same proportion that the portion of the municipality's tax increment that the municipality is required to pay into the fund is reduced.  The portion of the tax increment produced by a municipality that the municipality is required to pay into the tax increment fund for a reinvestment zone, as reduced by the ordinance adopted under this subsection, together with all other revenues required to be paid into the fund, must be sufficient to complete and pay for the estimated costs of projects listed in the reinvestment zone financing plan and pay any tax increment bonds or notes issued for the zone, and any other obligations of the zone.
(n)  This subsection applies only to a school district whose taxable value computed under Section 
403.302
(d), Government Code, is reduced in accordance with Subdivision (4) of that subsection.  In addition to the amount otherwise required to be paid into the tax increment fund, the district shall pay into the fund an amount equal to the amount by which the amount of taxes the district would have been required to pay into the fund in the current year if the district levied taxes at the rate the district levied in 2005 exceeds the amount the district is otherwise required to pay into the fund in the year of the reduction.  This additional amount may not exceed the amount the school district receives in state aid for the current tax year under Section 
48.253
, Education Code.  The school district shall pay the additional amount after the district receives the state aid to which the district is entitled for the current tax year under Section 
48.253
, Education Code.

Sec. 311.015.  TAX INCREMENT BONDS AND NOTES.  (a)  A municipality designating a reinvestment zone may issue tax increment bonds or notes, the proceeds of which may be used to make payments pursuant to agreements made under Section 
311.010
(b), to pay project costs for the reinvestment zone on behalf of which the bonds or notes were issued, or to satisfy claims of holders of the bonds or notes. The municipality may issue refunding bonds or notes for the payment or retirement of tax increment bonds or notes previously issued by it.
(b)  Tax increment bonds and notes are payable, as to both principal and interest, solely from the tax increment fund established for the reinvestment zone.  The governing body of the municipality may pledge irrevocably all or part of the fund for payment of tax increment bonds or notes.  The part of the fund pledged in payment may be used only for the payment of the bonds or notes or interest on the bonds or notes until the bonds or notes have been fully paid.  A holder of the bonds or notes or of coupons issued on the bonds has a lien against the fund for payment of the bonds or notes and interest on the bonds or notes and may protect or enforce the lien at law or in equity.
(c)  Tax increment bonds are issued by ordinance of the municipality without any additional approval other than that of the attorney general.
(d)  Tax increment bonds or notes, together with the interest on and income from those bonds or notes, are exempt from all taxes.
(e)  The issuing municipality may provide in the contract with the owners or holders of tax increment bonds that it will pay into the tax increment fund all or any part of the revenue produced or received from the operation or sale of a facility acquired, improved, or constructed pursuant to a project plan, to be used to pay principal and interest on the bonds.  If the municipality agrees, the owners or holders of tax increment bonds may have a lien or mortgage on a facility acquired, improved, or constructed with the proceeds of the bonds.
(f)  Tax increment bonds may be issued in one or more series.  The ordinance approving a tax increment bond or note, or the trust indenture or mortgage issued in connection with the bond or note, shall provide:
(1)  the date that the bond or note bears;
(2)  that the bond or note is payable on demand or at a specified time;
(3)  the interest rate that the bond or note bears;
(4)  the denomination of the bond or note;
(5)  whether the bond or note is in coupon or registered form;
(6)  the conversion or registration privileges of the bond or note;
(7)  the rank or priority of the bond or note;
(8)  the manner of execution of the bond or note;
(9)  the medium of payment in which and the place or places at which the bond or note is payable;
(10)  the terms of redemption, with or without premium, to which the bond or note is subject;
(11)  the manner in which the bond or note is secured;  and
(12)  any other characteristic of the bond or note.
(g)  A bond or note issued under this chapter is fully negotiable.  In a suit, action, or other proceeding involving the validity or enforceability of a bond or note issued under this chapter or the security of a bond or note issued under this chapter, if the bond or note recites in substance that it was issued by the municipality for a reinvestment zone, the bond or note is conclusively deemed to have been issued for that purpose, and the development or redevelopment of the zone is conclusively deemed to have been planned, located, and carried out as provided by this chapter.
(h)  A bank, trust company, savings bank or institution, savings and loan association, investment company or other person carrying on a banking or investment business;  an insurance company, insurance association, or other person carrying on an insurance business;  or an executor, administrator, curator, trustee, or other fiduciary may invest any sinking funds, money, or other funds belonging to it or in its control in tax increment bonds or notes issued under this chapter.  Tax increment bonds or notes are authorized security for all public deposits.  A person, political subdivision, or public or private officer may use funds owned or controlled by the person, political subdivision, or officer to purchase tax increment bonds or notes.  This chapter does not relieve any person of the duty to exercise reasonable care in selecting securities.
(i)  A tax increment bond or note is not a general obligation of the municipality issuing the bond or note.  A tax increment bond or note does not give rise to a charge against the general credit or taxing powers of the municipality and is not payable except as provided by this chapter.  A tax increment bond or note issued under this chapter must state the restrictions of this subsection on its face.
(i-1)  A municipality's obligation to deposit sales and use taxes into the tax increment fund is not a general obligation of the municipality.  An obligation to make payments from sales and use taxes under Section 
311.0123
 does not give rise to a charge against the general credit or taxing powers of the municipality and is not payable except as provided by this chapter.  A tax increment bond or note issued under this chapter that pledges payments made under Section 
311.0123
 must state the restrictions of this subsection on its face.
(j)  A tax increment bond or note may not be included in any computation of the debt of the issuing municipality.
(k)  A municipality may not issue tax increment bonds or notes in an amount that exceeds the total cost of implementing the project plan for the reinvestment zone for which the bonds or notes are issued.
(l)  A tax increment bond or note must mature on or before the date by which the final payments of tax increment into the tax increment fund are due.

Sec. 312.204.  MUNICIPAL TAX ABATEMENT AGREEMENT.  (a)  The governing body of a municipality eligible to enter into tax abatement agreements under Section 
312.002
 may agree in writing with the owner of taxable real property that is located in a reinvestment zone, but that is not in an improvement project financed by tax increment bonds, to exempt from taxation a portion of the value of the real property or of tangible personal property located on the real property, or both, for a period not to exceed 10 years, on the condition that the owner of the property make specific improvements or repairs to the property.  The governing body of an eligible municipality may agree in writing with the owner of a leasehold interest in tax-exempt real property that is located in a reinvestment zone, but that is not in an improvement project financed by tax increment bonds, to exempt a portion of the value of property subject to ad valorem taxation, including the leasehold interest, improvements, or tangible personal property located on the real property, for a period not to exceed 10 years, on the condition that the owner of the leasehold interest make specific improvements or repairs to the real property.  A tax abatement agreement under this section is subject to the rights of holders of outstanding bonds of the municipality.  An agreement exempting taxable real property or leasehold interests or improvements on tax-exempt real property may provide for the exemption of such taxable interests in each year covered by the agreement only to the extent its value for that year exceeds its value for the year in which the agreement is executed.  An agreement exempting tangible personal property located on taxable or tax-exempt real property may provide for the exemption of tangible personal property located on the real property in each year covered by the agreement other than tangible personal property that was located on the real property at any time before the period covered by the agreement with the municipality, including inventory and supplies.  In a municipality that has a comprehensive zoning ordinance, an improvement, repair, development, or redevelopment taking place under an agreement under this section must conform to the comprehensive zoning ordinance.
(b)  The agreements made with the owners of property in a reinvestment zone must contain identical terms for the portion of the value of the property that is to be exempt and the duration of the exemption.  For purposes of this subsection, if agreements made with the owners of property in a reinvestment zone before September 1, 1989, exceed 10 years in duration, agreements made with owners of property in the zone on or after that date must have a duration of 10 years.
(c)  The property subject to an agreement made under this section may be located in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality.  In that event, the agreement applies to taxes of the municipality if the municipality annexes the property during the period specified in the agreement.
(d)  Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, property that is in a reinvestment zone and that is owned or leased by a person who is a member of the governing body of the municipality or a member of a zoning or planning board or commission of the municipality is excluded from property tax abatement or tax increment financing.  Property that is subject to a tax abatement agreement in effect when the person becomes a member of the governing body or of the zoning or planning board or commission does not cease to be eligible for property tax abatement under that agreement because of the person's membership on the governing body, board, or commission.  Property that is subject to tax increment financing when the person becomes a member of the governing body or of the zoning or planning board or commission does not become ineligible for tax increment financing in the same reinvestment zone because of the person's membership on the governing body, board, or commission.
(e)  The governing body of a municipality eligible to enter into tax abatement agreements under Section 
312.002
 may agree in writing with the owner or lessee of real property that is located in a reinvestment zone to exempt from taxation for a period not to exceed 10 years a portion of the value of the real property or of personal property, or both, located within the zone and owned or leased by a certificated air carrier, on the condition that the certificated air carrier make specific real property improvements or lease for a term of 10 years or more real property improvements located within the reinvestment zone.  An agreement may provide for the exemption of the real property in each year covered by the agreement to the extent its value for that year exceeds its value for the year in which the agreement is executed.  An agreement may provide for the exemption of the personal property owned or leased by a certificated air carrier located within the reinvestment zone in each year covered by the agreement other than specific personal property that was located within the reinvestment zone at any time before the period covered by the agreement with the municipality.
(f)  The agreements made with owners of property in an enterprise zone that is also designated as a reinvestment zone are not required to contain identical terms for the portion of the value of property that is to be exempt and the duration of the agreement.
(g)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, the governing body of a municipality eligible to enter into tax abatement agreements under Section 
312.002
 may agree in writing with the owner of real property that is located in a reinvestment zone to exempt from taxation for a period not to exceed five years a portion of the value of the real property or of tangible personal property located on the real property, or both, that is used to provide housing for military personnel employed at a military facility located in or near the municipality.  An agreement may provide for the exemption of the real property in each year covered by the agreement only to the extent its value for that year exceeds its value for the year in which the agreement is executed.  An agreement may provide for the exemption of tangible personal property located on the real property in each year covered by the agreement other than tangible personal property that was located on the real property at any time before the period covered by the agreement with the municipality and other than inventory or supplies.  The governing body of the municipality may adopt guidelines and criteria for tax abatement agreements entered into under this subsection that are different from the guidelines and criteria that apply to tax abatement agreements entered into under another provision of this section.  Tax abatement agreements entered into under this subsection are not required to contain identical terms for the portion of the value of the property that is to be exempt or for the duration of the exemption as tax abatement agreements entered into with the owners of property in the reinvestment zone under another provision of this section.
(h)  The Texas Department of Economic Development or its successor may recommend that a taxing unit enter into a tax abatement agreement with a person under this chapter.  In determining whether to enter into a tax abatement agreement under this section, the governing body of a municipality shall consider any recommendation made by the Texas Department of Economic Development or its successor.

Sec. 312.206.  TAX ABATEMENT BY OTHER TAXING UNITS.  (a)  If property taxes on property located in the taxing jurisdiction of a municipality are abated under an agreement made under Section 
312.204
 or 
312.211
, the governing body of each other taxing unit eligible to enter into tax abatement agreements under Section 
312.002
 in which the property is located may execute a written tax abatement agreement with the owner of the property. The agreement is not required to contain terms identical to those contained in the agreement with the municipality.  The execution, duration, and other terms of an agreement made under this section are governed by the provisions of Sections 
312.204
, 
312.205
, and 
312.211
 applicable to a municipality. If the governing body of the taxing unit by official action at any time before the execution of the municipal agreement expresses an intent to be bound by the terms of the municipal agreement if the municipality enters into an agreement under Section 
312.204
 or 
312.211
 with the owner relating to the property, the terms of the municipal agreement regarding the share of the property to be exempt in each year of the municipal agreement apply to the taxation of the property by the taxing unit.
(b)  If property taxes on property located in the taxing jurisdiction of a municipality are abated under an agreement made by the municipality before September 1, 1989, the terms of the agreement with the municipality regarding the share of the property that is to be exempt in each year of the agreement apply to the taxation of the property by every other taxing unit, other than a county or school district, in which the property is located. If the agreement was made before September 1, 1987, the terms regarding the share of the property to be exempt in each year of the agreement also apply to the taxation of the property by a county or school district.
(c)  If the governing body of a municipality designates a reinvestment zone that includes property in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality, the governing body of a taxing unit eligible to enter into tax abatement agreements under Section 
312.002
 in which the property is located may execute a written agreement with the owner of the property to exempt from its property taxes all or part of the value of the property in the same manner and subject to the same restrictions as provided by Section 
312.204
 or 
312.211
 for a municipality.  The taxing unit may execute an agreement even if the municipality does not execute an agreement for the property, and the terms of the agreement are not required to be identical to the terms of a municipal agreement.

(d)  If property taxes are abated on property in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality due to an agreement with a county or school district made before September 1, 1989, the terms of the agreement with the county or school district relating to the share of the property that is to be exempt in each year of the agreement apply to the taxation of the property by every other taxing unit, other than a municipality, school district, or county, in which the property is located.
(e)  If property taxes on property located in an enterprise zone are abated under this chapter, the governing body of each taxing jurisdiction may execute a written agreement with the owner of the property not later than the 90th day after the date the municipal or county agreement is executed, whichever is later.  The agreement may, but is not required to, contain terms that are identical to those contained in the agreement with the municipality, county, or both, whichever applies, and the only terms of the agreement that may vary are the portion of the property that is to be exempt from taxation under the agreement and the duration of the agreement.

Sec. 313.002.  FINDINGS.  The legislature finds that:
(1)  many states have enacted aggressive economic development laws designed to attract large employers, create jobs, and strengthen their economies;
(2)  given Texas' relatively high ad valorem taxes, it is difficult for the state to compete for new capital projects without temporarily limiting ad valorem taxes imposed on new capital investments;
(3)  a significant portion of the Texas economy continues to be based in manufacturing and other capital-intensive industries, and their continued growth and overall health serve the Texas economy well;
(4)  without a vibrant, strong manufacturing sector, other sectors of the economy, especially the state's service sector, will also suffer adverse consequences; and
(5)  the current ad valorem tax system of this state does not favor capital-intensive businesses such as manufacturers.

(4)  enable state and local government officials and economic development professionals to compete with other states by authorizing economic development incentives that are comparable to incentives being offered to prospective employers by other states and to provide state and local officials with an effective means to attract large-scale investment;
(5)  strengthen and improve the overall performance of the economy of this state;
(6)  expand and enlarge the ad valorem tax base of this state; and
(7)  enhance this state's economic development efforts by providing state and local officials with an effective economic development tool.

The proposition for adopting a tax under this section and the proposition for creation of a fire control, prevention, and emergency medical services district shall be submitted at the same election.  For purposes of Section 
321.101

(c)  The rate of a tax adopted for a district under this section may be increased in increments of one-eighth of one percent, not to exceed a total tax rate of one-half percent, for financing the operation of the fire control, prevention, and emergency medical services district by order of the board of directors of the fire control, prevention, and emergency medical services district if approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting at an election called by the board and held in the district on the question of increasing the tax rate.

(a)  Subject to an election held in accordance with the Crime Control and Prevention District Act, a county in which a crime control and prevention district is established shall adopt a sales and use tax in the area of the district for the purpose of financing the operation of the crime control and prevention district.  The revenue from the tax may be used only for the purpose of financing the operation of the crime control and prevention district.  The proposition for adopting a tax under this section and the proposition for creation of a crime control and prevention district shall be submitted at the same election.  For purposes of Subsection (c) of Section 
323.101
 of this code, a tax under this section is not a county sales and use tax.
(b)  A tax adopted for a district under this section for financing the operation of the district may be decreased in increments of one-eighth of one percent by order of the board of directors of the district.
(c)  The board of directors or the governing body of the governmental entity that proposed the creation of the crime control and prevention district may call an election on the question of decreasing the tax rate in increments of one-eighth of one percent in the district if the district was created before January 1, 1996.  The board of directors or governing body may dedicate a portion of the tax for the payment of bonds used in conjunction with the renovation or extension of a county-owned or municipally owned convention center facility, as defined in Section 
351.001
, that was constructed before 1969 if the dedication is approved by a majority of the qualified voters in an election held in the district on the question of decreasing the tax rate.

351.001
, Tax Code, and authorizing that the tax expire on payment of the bonds."
(d)  The rate of a tax adopted for a district under this section may be increased in increments of one-eighth of one percent, not to exceed a total tax rate of one-half percent for financing the operation of the crime control and prevention district, by order of the board of directors of the crime control and prevention district if approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting at an election called by the board and held in the district on the question of increasing the tax rate.  At the election, the ballot shall be printed to provide for voting for or against the following proposition:  "The increase of the ____________ Crime Control and Prevention District sales and use tax rate to ____________ percent."  If there is an increase or decrease under this subsection in the rate of a tax imposed under this section, the new rate takes effect on the first day of the next calendar quarter after the expiration of one calendar quarter after the comptroller receives notice of the increase or decrease.  However, if the comptroller notifies the president of the board of directors of the district in writing within 10 days after receipt of the notification that the comptroller requires more time to implement reporting and collection procedures, the comptroller may delay implementation of the rate change for one whole calendar quarter.  In that event, the new rate takes effect on the first day of the next calendar quarter following the elapsed quarter.
(e)  The comptroller shall remit to the county amounts collected at the rate imposed under this section as part of the regular allocation of county tax revenue collected by the comptroller if the district is composed of the entire county.  The comptroller shall, if the district is composed of an area less than the entire county, remit that amount to the district.  Retailers may not be required to use the allocation and reporting procedures in the collection of taxes under this section different from the procedures that retailers use in the collection of other sales and use taxes under this chapter.  An item, transaction, or service that is taxable in a county under a sales or use tax authorized by another section of this chapter is taxable under this section.  An item, transaction, or service that is not taxable in a county under a sales or use tax authorized by another section of this chapter is not taxable under this section.
(f)  If, in a county where a crime control and prevention district is composed of the whole county, a county sales and use tax or a county sales and use tax rate increase for the purpose of financing a crime control and prevention district is approved, the county is responsible for distributing to the district that portion of the county sales and use tax revenue received from the comptroller that is to be used for the purposes of financing the crime control and prevention district.  Not later than the 10th day after the date the county receives funds under this section from the comptroller, the county shall make the distribution in the proportion that the crime control and prevention portion of the tax rate bears to the total sales and use tax rate of the county.  The amounts distributed to a crime control and prevention district are not considered to be sales and use tax revenue for the purpose of property tax reduction and computation of the county tax rate under Section 
26.041
, Tax Code.
(g)  For purposes of the tax imposed under this section, a reference in this chapter to the county as the territory in which the tax or an incident of the tax applies means only the territory located in the crime control and prevention district, if that district is composed of an area less than an entire county.
(h)  The comptroller may adopt rules and the county commissioners court may adopt orders to administer this section.
